Week-End Camp</h1>


<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="f8">A LETTER</span></h2>


<p class="center">From Douglas Carter to her mother, Mrs.
Robert Carter</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right smcap">Greendale, Va., August &mdash;, 19&mdash;.</p>

<p class="smcap">My darling Mother:</p>

<p>Words cannot express the joy and gratitude
all of us feel that father is really getting well.
I shall never forget the miserable time last
spring when Dr. Wright came into the library
where Helen and Nan and Lucy and I were
sitting and told us of his very serious condition.
I had felt he was in a very bad way
but did not realize it was quite so dreadful. I
am sure you did not, either. And when Dr.
Wright said that you must take him on a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
sea voyage and we understood that we were to
be left behind, the bottom seemed to drop out
of the universe.</p>

<p>And now, dear mother, I have a confession
to make: You took for granted we were going
to the springs when we wrote we were to spend
the summer in the mountains, and we thought
with all the worry you had about father, perhaps
it was best to let you go on thinking it.
Of course you did not dream of the necessity
of our doing anything to make money as father
had never told you much about his finances.
Well, mother dear, there was about $80 in the
bank in father&rsquo;s private account. Fortunately
for the business, which Mr. Lane and Dick
have carried on to the best of their ability, there
was some more in another account, but we
have managed without touching that. I
hope I am not going to shock you now, but you
shall have to know it&mdash;we have rented our lovely
home, furnished, for six months with privilege
of a year, and we have sold the car, dismissed
the servants&mdash;all but Susan and Oscar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
who are up here at Greendale with us. This
is what might shock you: We are running a
week-end boarding camp here in the mountains
and the really shocking part of it is&mdash;we are
making money!</p>

<p>It was a scheme that popped into Helen&rsquo;s head
and it seemed such an excellent one that we
fell to it, and with dear Cousin Lizzie Somerville
chaperoning us and Lewis Somerville protecting
us, we have opened our camp and actually
would have to turn away boarders except
that the boys are always willing to sleep
out-of-doors and that makes room for others
not so inclined.</p>

<p>We see Dr. Wright quite often. He comes
up for the Sunday in his car whenever he can
spare the time. He has been kindness itself
and has helped us over many rough places.
There have been times when we have been downhearted
and depressed over you and father, and
then it has been his office to step in and reassure
us that father was really getting better.
He and Bobby are sworn friends and there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
nothing Bobby will not do for him&mdash;even keep
himself clean.</p>

<p>We are well. Indeed, the mountain air has
done wonders for all of us. Helen is working
harder than any of us, but is the picture of
health in spite of it. Nan is more robust than
she has ever been in her life. I think the tendency
she has always had to bronchitis has entirely
disappeared. Dr. Wright says it is sleeping
out-of-doors that has fixed her. Lucy has
grown two inches, I do believe. She has been
very sweet and helpful and as happy as the
day is long with her chum Lil Tate here for the
whole summer. Mrs. Tate brought her up for
a week-end and the child has been with us now
for over two months. We have two boys of
fifteen who are here for the summer, too, Frank
Maury and Skeeter Halsey. They are a great
comfort to me as I feel sure Lucy and Lil will
be taken care of by these nice boys.</p>

<p>Of course, the original idea of our camp was
to have only week-end boarders, but we find it
very nice to have some steadies besides as that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
means a certain fixed amount of money, but
I am not going to let you worry your pretty
head about money. We have a perennial guest,
also&mdash;none other than pretty, silly Tillie Wingo.
She came to the opening week-end and proved
herself to be such a drawing card for the male
sex that we decided it would be good business
to ask her to visit us indefinitely. It was Nan&rsquo;s
idea. You know Tillie well enough to understand
that she is always thoroughly good-natured
and kind without being helpful in any way.
All she has to do is look pretty and chatter and
giggle. Of course she must dance, and she does
that divinely. She is a kind of social entertainer,
and the number of youths who swarm
to Week-End Camp because of her would astonish
you. She is certainly worth her keep. Here
I am touching on finances again when I did not
mean to at all.</p>

<p>We are so happy at the thought of having
you and father with us for the rest of the summer.
Dr. Wright thinks the life here will be
almost as good for father as that on shipboard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
provided the week-enders do not make too much
racket for him. If they do, we are to have a
tent pitched for him out of ear-shot. Poor
Cousin Lizzie Somerville is very happy over
your coming because it will release her. Her
duties as chaperone have not been very strenuous,
but the life up here has been so different
from anything she has ever had before that it
has been hard on her, I know, harder than she
has ever divulged, I am sure. Now she can
go to her beloved springs and play as many
games of cards as she chooses.</p>

<p>Dr. Wright says it would be better for you
not to go to Richmond at all before coming here,
as father might want to go to work again, and
it is very important for him to be kept from it
for many months yet. He is to meet you in New
York and bring you straight to Greendale. I
can go down to Richmond with you after we
get father settled here, and we can get what
clothes you want for the mountains. We have
everything in the way of clothes stored at
Cousin Lizzie Somerville&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>It is very lovely here at Greendale, and I do
hope you and father will like it as much as we
have. Dr. Wright will tell you more about it
when he meets you in New York on Wednesday.
I am sending this letter by him as it seems
safer than to trust to Uncle Sam.</p>

<p>We only hope the life up here will not be too
rough for you. We will do all we can to smooth
it for you; but a camp is a camp, you know, dear
mother. Our best love to father.</p>

<p><span class="sign2">Your loving daughter,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">Douglas.</span><br /></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="f8">THE RETURN</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Oh, Douglas, I&rsquo;m all of a tremble!&rdquo; declared
Helen Carter, as she knotted her jaunty
scarlet tie and settled her gray felt hat at exactly
the proper angle. &ldquo;To think that they are
really coming back!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can hardly believe it. The time has gone
quickly and still it seems somehow as though
we had been living in this camp for ages. I am
afraid it will go hard with the poor little
mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cousin Lizzie stood it and she is years and
years older than mother,&rdquo; and Helen looked critically
at her dainty nose and rubbed a little
powder on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, but Cousin Lizzie is made of
sterner stuff than poor little mumsy. I think
that mother is the kind of woman that men
would fight to protect but when all is told that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Cousin Lizzie is the kind who would go out
and help fight if need be. I can fancy her loading
rifles and handing them to the men&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So can I,&rdquo; laughed Helen, &ldquo;and saying as she
loaded: &lsquo;To everything there is a season, and
a time to every purpose under the heaven; a
time to kill and a time to heal.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am ashamed of myself&mdash;but somehow I
am glad Cousin Lizzie did not think it was
her duty to defer her going until mother and
father got here. She has been splendid and
too good to us for anything, but it is a kind
of relief for her to be out of the cabin and away
before they come,&rdquo; said Douglas as she completed
her rapid dressing by pulling an old khaki
hat down over her rather refractory, if very
lovely Titian hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know just what you mean. I hoped all
the time she would realize that the morning
train was much the better one for her to get
off on, and then she could reach the springs in
time for an afternoon game. It was a feeling
I had that she might be too critical of poor little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
mumsy. You see we don&rsquo;t know just how
camp life is going to appeal to mumsy,&rdquo; said
Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly! It may take her a while to get used
to it,&rdquo; and Douglas let a little sigh escape her.
&ldquo;I wish they could have arrived on any other
day than Friday. Our week-ends in August
have been so full. I fancy many of the week-enders
will want to stay on for holidays, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it is only not too much for father. Dr.
Wright thinks it won&rsquo;t be. He says noise in the
open air is so different from housed noises for
nervous persons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A honk from the faithful old mountain goat,
a name they had given the ancient Ford that
Bill Tinsley had contributed to the camp&rsquo;s use,
warned them it was time to start for the station.
One more dab of powder on Helen&rsquo;s nose
completed her toilet and calling to Nan and Lucy
to pile in, they started their ever perilous descent
of the mountain to Greendale.</p>

<p>Bobby, who had been captured by a determined
Susan and washed and dressed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
honor of his returning parents, was occupying
the seat of state in Josh&rsquo;s cart, clean but indignant
at the outrage committed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no sense in washin&rsquo;. I mos&rsquo; wisht
I&rsquo;d been born a pig. If I had, I betcher I&rsquo;d a
been a pet pig an&rsquo; some fool woman would er
wanted to curl my tail and tie a bow &rsquo;round my
neck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such pessimism was too much for Josh, who
shook with laughter as the slab-sided mule, Josephus,
limped cheerfully down the mountain
road.</p>

<p>To think that mother and father were really
coming! The Carter girls lined themselves
along the little station awaiting the train bearing
the beloved passengers. What a healthy-looking
quartette they were after a whole summer
in the open. Douglas&rsquo; fair skin was reddened
from exposure and her hair showed the lack
of care that her mother had always exacted.
Douglas attached very little importance to her
appearance, and was constantly being put to
rights by the more correct Helen. Even now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
as they waited for the train, Helen was regretting
that she had permitted her older sister to
wear the very disgraceful-looking khaki hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Khaki color is certainly unbecoming to
blondes,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I do want Douglas to
look her best for mother. Father will think all
of us are beautiful, anyhow, no matter what
we wear,&rdquo; and Helen could not help a feeling
of satisfaction over her own very becoming
cold-gravy costume with the touch of scarlet at
her throat. It had seen much service but still
had that unmistakable air of style that was
characteristic of all of Helen Carter&rsquo;s belongings.</p>

<p>Nan was quite robust-looking for Nan. She
had inherited from her mother that soft black
hair and those dusky eyes and a complexion of
wondrous fairness that is seen sometimes in a
rare type of Creole beauty. Mrs. Carter&rsquo;s almost
angelic beauty (her few enemies called it
doll-like) was repeated in her daughter in a
somewhat more sturdy edition. Nan&rsquo;s mouth
was larger and her eyes not quite so enormous;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
her nose a bit broader at the base and her chin
squarer. Her attractive countenance showed a
mixture of poetic feeling and sturdy common
sense with a plentiful seasoning of humor and
gave promise of her development into a very
enchanting woman. All Nan asked of life was
plenty of books and time to read them and a
cloak of invisibility so that she would not be
noticed. She was gradually overcoming the shyness
that had always made her think that next
to a cloak of invisibility the greatest boon her
fairy godmother could grant her would be seven-league
boots, so that she could get away from
all embarrassing persons even if she could not
hide from them. The summer of camping had
certainly taken from her the look of fragility that
had always been a source of uneasiness to her
father but which her beautiful mother had
rather prided herself on as it was in her eyes a
mark of race and breeding.</p>

<p>Lucy Carter, the youngest of the four, was
developing rapidly into a very attractive girl.
Her resemblance to Helen was growing more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
marked, much to her pretended disgust, but
to her secret delight. Already her long legs
had shot her saucy head up to within a level of
Helen&rsquo;s, which made the younger sister ecstatically
confident of her equality with the elder,
whom in her heart of hearts she considered
a paragon of perfection but with whom she was
usually on sparring terms.</p>

<p>Bobby, the idolized little brother, had changed
more than any of the Carters during that summer.
He had lost forever the baby curves and
had taken on a lean, wiry spareness. His almost
unearthly beauty was gone by reason of a
great gap in his face caused by the loss of his
first teeth. One permanent tooth had found
its way through and, as is the way with the first
permanent tooth, seemed very enormous in contrast
to the tiny little pearls that had hitherto
passed for teeth. His knees were scarred and
scratched as were his lean brown legs. Two
sore toes were tied up in dirty rags, having been
ministered to by Aunt Mandy, the kind old
mountain woman who bore the proud distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
in Bobby&rsquo;s mind of being the mother of
Josh the boy and the owner of Josephus the mule.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear the whistle!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucy, prancing
with excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I, but it is the saw mill over in the
hollow,&rdquo; drawled Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it be terrible if the train is late and
all the week-enders get here before mother and
father?&rdquo; wailed Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Awful!&rdquo; exclaimed Douglas. &ldquo;If we can
only get them settled in the cabin before the
hullabaloo begins, maybe it won&rsquo;t seem so bad to
them. I just can&rsquo;t stand it if the camp is going
to be too much for father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m most sure he will like it, but it&rsquo;s mother
who will be the one to kick,&rdquo; said Nan. Kicking
was not a very elegant way to express what no
doubt would be the state of Mrs. Carter&rsquo;s mind
over the rough camp life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a-comin&rsquo; now!&rdquo; shouted Bobby. &ldquo;I kin
hear her a-chuggin&rsquo; up grade! Listen! This is
what she says: &lsquo;Catch a nigger! Catch a nigger!
I&rsquo;m a-comin&rsquo;! I&rsquo;m a-comin&rsquo;!&rsquo;&rdquo; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
scion of the Carter family whistled shrilly
through his sparse teeth, an accomplishment that
had but recently come to him by reason of his
loss.</p>

<p>It was the train and on time, which would
give the youthful proprietors of the week-end
boarding camp time to get their invalid father
and dainty mother safely stowed away in the
cabin before the onrush of harum-scarum guests
should begin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven!&rdquo; was the pious ejaculation of
the older girls.</p>

<p>Douglas and Helen felt all the qualms and
responsibilities that had been theirs on the opening
of the camp at the beginning of the summer.
It had proved such a success that confidence
had come to them, but now that their
parents were to join them, although they were
very happy at the thought of seeing them, they
had grave doubts about the way in which their
mother would look upon their venture and about
the ability of their father to endure the noise
and confusion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Wright, who had gone to New York to
meet the steamer, got off first, laden with parcels.
Then came Mrs. Carter, looking so young
and pretty that her daughters felt suddenly
very mature. Mr. Carter followed his wife.
He also was laden with bandboxes and bundles,
while the grinning porter emerged with
some difficulty from under a mass of suitcases,
steamer rugs and dress boxes. Lewis Somerville
extricated him in time for him to jump on
the departing train as it made its laborious way
up the steep grade, still singing the song that
Bobby had declared it sang: &ldquo;Catch a nigger!
Catch a nigger! I&rsquo;m a-comin&rsquo;! I&rsquo;m a-comin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My girls! My girls!&rdquo; Mrs. Carter flew
from one to the other like a butterfly who cannot
tell which flower to light on, but Robert
Carter dropped his parcels and enfolded all of
them in a mighty embrace. How lean and
brown he was! On sight he seemed like his
old self to Helen, who was the first to find her
way to his eager arms and the last to leave their
encircling shelter. A closer scrutiny of his face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
however, told her there was still something
wrong. His snap and vim were gone. Intelligence
shone from his kind blue eyes and his countenance
bespoke contentment and happiness, but
his old sparkle and alertness were missing. The
overworked nerves had lost their elasticity and a
certain power that had been a part of Robert
Carter was gone forever. It was the power of
leading and directing, taking the initiative. There
was something very pathetic about it all, just as
though a great general had been reduced to the
ranks and must ever after serve as a private.
What made it sadder was that he seemed content
to follow. Someone else must work out the
problem of how to keep his expensive family in
all the luxuries they had demanded. It was no
longer up to him! That was the way his expression
impressed Helen. She escaped from the
others and ran behind the little station.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father! Father!&rdquo; she sobbed in an agony
of love and misery. &ldquo;He is not well yet! He
never will be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, he will,&rdquo; said a quiet, deep voice. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
belonged to George Wright, who had come
around the other side of the waiting room after
helping Lewis Somerville deposit the luggage in
Josh&rsquo;s cart. &ldquo;He is much better, better than I
dared dream he would be. You see, he has had
only four months and I said all the time it would
take a year of rest and maybe more. What
makes you think he is still so badly off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Wright had a ridiculous notion that he
could explain to Helen much better her father&rsquo;s
condition if she would only put her head on his
shoulder and do her sobbing there, but he buried
his hands firmly in his pockets and made no intimation
of his idea. He had constantly to take
himself to task for forgetting that Helen was
little more than a child. &ldquo;You must wait, you
fool!&rdquo; he would reason with himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But suppose someone else doesn&rsquo;t wait and
she gets snapped up before your eyes&mdash;what
then?&rdquo; But wait he felt he must, and in the
meantime Helen often felt that his sternness
meant disapproval and wondered what she had
done to merit it&mdash;that is, what new thing. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
course she always knew she had merited his
disapproval by her behavior when he had given
the verdict that her father must go off on the
voyage for health. And now when he said:
&ldquo;What makes you think he is still so badly off?&rdquo;
he sounded very stern and superior.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He seems so&mdash;so&mdash;meek,&rdquo; she faltered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, who would not be meek with all those
parcels?&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Your mother had only
part of a day in New York, but she bought out
the town. I&rsquo;m meek myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conversation was interrupted by Lucy,
who was always eager to find out what Helen
was doing so she could do it too. When she
saw her sister&rsquo;s tear-stained countenance she
bitterly regretted her dry eyes but cry she could
not, especially as she did not see anything to
cry about.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter, meanwhile, after flitting from
daughter to daughter, had cried out: &ldquo;But
Bobby! Where is my precious Bobby?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here me!&rdquo; said that youngster. &ldquo;We uns
ain&rsquo;t fur.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Bobby! Bobby! I didn&rsquo;t know you! Where
are your teeth? Why did you have your hair
cut so short? My baby, my baby!&rdquo; and the
poor little lady enfolded a rather abashed boy
in her arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baby your grandmother! I ain&rsquo;t nobody&rsquo;s
baby. We uns is Dr. Wright&rsquo;s shover cept&rsquo;n
when we uns is in the mountings and thin we
uns is the &rsquo;spressman&rsquo;s sisterant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We uns? What do you mean, Bobby?&rdquo;
wailed the mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say we uns whenever we uns thinks to do
it. That&rsquo;s the way mountingyears talks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robert! Robert, look at Bobby and listen to
him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Carter did look at Bobby and the remembrance
of his own boyhood came back to
him and he laughed as he seldom did now-a-days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, bless my soul, what a great big son
I have got!&rdquo; and he slapped Bobby on the back.
&ldquo;I fancy you are too big to kiss, you rascal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t too big to kiss if you uns comes behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the station where Josh&rsquo;n Josephus can&rsquo;t
see us,&rdquo; and Bobby led his willing parent behind
the station where Helen had gone to shed
a bitter tear and where Dr. Wright had discovered
her and where Lucy had discovered
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, shucks! They&rsquo;s too many folks here,&rdquo; he
declared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will all of you please step out of the way?&rdquo;
begged Mr. Carter. &ldquo;Bobby has an important
thing to discuss with me and we should like
the back of the station to ourselves for a moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Left alone, the big man held his little son
tight in his arms and in spite of Bobby&rsquo;s boasted
manhood he was very happy to be once more
hugged and kissed by his father.</p>

<p>Dr. Wright smiled into Helen&rsquo;s reddened eyes
and said: &ldquo;Bobby will do more for your father
than anyone else now. If he can be a boy again
he will get entirely well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The many parcels were at last stowed away
in the cart and Josh clucked sadly to Josephus.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon Bobby&rsquo;s done left us all, now that
his paw is come,&rdquo; he said sadly to the sympathetic
mule. But Bobby came running after
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi there! Wait, Josh! Father says he
would sooner trust his bones to us than that old
Tin Lizzie. You&rsquo;n him&rsquo;n me can squzzle in on
the front seat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sho&rsquo; we kin!&rdquo; declared the delighted Josh.
He hadn&rsquo;t lost an old friend after all, but gained
a new one.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter proved even more agreeable to
the little mountain boy than his idol, Lewis
Somerville. He had such wonderful things to
tell of ships and things and seemed to understand
a boy so well. Mr. Somerville was right
strict with a fellow, expecting him to be clean
all the time and never forget, but somehow, Mr.
Carter was a little easier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are frightfully burned, Douglas,&rdquo; complained
Mrs. Carter as they finally got themselves
stowed away in the faithful mountain
goat. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see why you do not protect your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
skin. Your neck will take months to recover
from such a tanning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think that will make much difference,&rdquo;
laughed Douglas. &ldquo;I fancy it will
be many a day before I go décolleté.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that. If you are not going to
college, I see no reason why you should not
make your debut next winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas looked at her mother in amazement.
Could it be that even now she did not understand?
She said nothing, feeling that it would
be wiser to wait until she and her mother were
alone. Never having economized in her life,
Mrs. Carter did not know the meaning of the
word. The many parcels that were borne from
the train gave Douglas a faint feeling. Had
her mother been buying things in New York?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I brought you a perfect love of a hat, darling,&rdquo;
Mrs. Carter chattered on, &ldquo;but of course
you shall have to bleach up a bit for it to be
becoming to you. I did not dream you were so
burned or I should not have selected such pale
trimmings. I have a delightful plan! Since you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
are to come out next winter, I think a fortnight
at the White in late August would be
charming&mdash;give you that poise that debutantes
so often lack. We can leave the children with
your father and go together&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, mother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we shan&rsquo;t go quite yet! I know you want
to see your father for a few days before you
leave him even for a fortnight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas was speechless; Nan, who was crowded
in by her, gave her a sympathetic squeeze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is lovely to be with my girls again,&rdquo; the
little lady bubbled on. &ldquo;Of course your letter
was a great surprise to me, Douglas. The idea
of my children making money!&rdquo; and she gave a
silvery laugh. &ldquo;I am delighted that you have,
because now no doubt your coming out will be
even more delightful than I had anticipated.
Of course those persons who are in our house
in Richmond will simply have to get out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, mother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simply have to&mdash;how can a girl come out
suitably unless she is in her own home?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="f8">THE PROBLEM</span></h2>


<p>The cabin was looking very sweet and fresh
after a thorough cleaning from the willing hands
of Susan, who was in a state of bliss because
her beloved mistress was returning. Gwen had
found some belated Cherokee roses and with a
few sprays of honeysuckle added had glorified
the plain room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think Miss Lizzie Somerville is el&rsquo;gant!
Well, you jes&rsquo; oughter see my missis. She is the
mos&rsquo; el&rsquo;gantes&rsquo; lady in the whole er Richmond. I
bet Mis&rsquo; Carter ain&rsquo;t never in all her life done a
han&rsquo;s turn. Gawd knows what she gonter say
&rsquo;bout these here young ladies er hern workin&rsquo; like
they was in service,&rdquo; Susan remarked to the little
English Gwen, who had done many a hand&rsquo;s turn
herself and still had an elegance all her own, so
evident that the colored servants recognized her
as a &ldquo;lady bawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it is very wonderful that the Carter
girls should be able to work so well when they
have never been brought up to it,&rdquo; said Gwen
as she hung the last freshly laundered sash curtain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s they paw in &rsquo;em,&rdquo; declared Susan.
&ldquo;He is the wuckinest gemman I ever seed.
&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; he won&rsquo;t turn his han&rsquo; ter. He
don&rsquo;t never set back and holler fer help when
he wants the fire fixed er sech like. No&rsquo;m, he
jes&rsquo; jumps up an&rsquo; waits on hisself. Sometimes
he used ter git Mis&rsquo; Carter kinder put out &rsquo;cause
he&rsquo;d even do his own reaching at the table. Miss
Douglas is the spittin&rsquo; image of him. None
of the gals favors her much &rsquo;cep Miss Nan.
She looks like her but she ain&rsquo;t so langrous
like when they&rsquo;s work on hand. Miss Helen
is the same kind er spender as her maw. I
believe my soul them two would ruther buy than
eat. Cook used ter say that Mis&rsquo; Carter an&rsquo;
Miss Helen spent like we done come to the millionennium.
Great Gawd! Here they is an&rsquo; I
ain&rsquo;t got on my clean apron. That&rsquo;s one thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
that Mis&rsquo; Carter&rsquo;ll certainly git cross over&mdash;aprons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not, however. Too pleased to see
the faithful Susan, Mrs. Carter overlooked the
doubtful apron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a charming room! Is this where I am
to be? And you girls in the tents beyond? And
Bobby&mdash;where does Bobby sleep?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is with Lewis Somerville and his friend,
Bill Tinsley. I believe he wrote you about
Bill,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;&mdash;the young man who was
shipped from West Point when Lewis was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I remember! I am glad to see you
have not let yourself run down like Douglas,
my dear. Your hair looks well kept and your
complexion is perfect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas, much perturbed over her mother&rsquo;s
plans, had rushed off to be alone for a moment
to compose herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, mother, I don&rsquo;t burn like Douglas, and
then Douglas&rsquo; hair is so lovely it doesn&rsquo;t make
any difference what she does to it. Mine must
be well kept to pass muster. I hope you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
not going to find it too rough here for you,
mumsy,&rdquo; and Helen put a protecting arm around
the little mother, who was more like a sister,
and a younger one at that, than a mother to
these great girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think it is delightful for a while. Of
course I have been on shipboard so long that
I really am longing for some society. Did you
hear me tell Douglas what my plan is for her
and me? I should like to include you, too,
but perhaps it would be best for you to wait
a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I did not hear; you see the car is such
a noisy one that one never can hear. What
is your plan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to take Douglas to the White for
several weeks preparatory to her making her
debut this winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Debut!&rdquo; gasped Helen. &ldquo;White Sulphur!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, mother, we haven&rsquo;t money for clothes
and things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! Our credit is perfectly good. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
fancy there is not a man in Richmond who has
paid his bills so regularly as Robert Carter, and
now that he is not able to work for a few
months I feel sure there is not a single tradesman
with whom we have always dealt who
would not be more than pleased to have us on
his books for any amount.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted to charge a lot of things I thought
we needed, but Douglas just wouldn&rsquo;t have it.
She never does realize the importance of clothes.
I don&rsquo;t mean to criticize Douglas, she is wonderful,
but she is careless about clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I shall put a stop to that, now that I
am back with my children. Your father is so
much better I can give my time to other things
now. How exciting it will be to have a daughter
in society! I never did want Douglas to go
to college. What made her give it up? She
never did say what her reason was. Letters
are very unsatisfactory things when one is on
shipboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was money, of course,&rdquo; said Helen.
&ldquo;There was no money for college.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, to be sure! I forgot that college takes
cash. Well, I am heartily glad she has given
it up. I think college girls get too independent.
I am dying to show you my purchases in New
York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am dying to see them, too, but, mumsy,
I shall have to leave you now and run and do a
million things. We have a great crowd of
week-enders coming up on the late train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Susan attend to the things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Susan does a lot, but I am the chief
cook and Douglas is the brains of the concern
and looks after all the money and does the
buying. Nan attends to all the letter writing,
and you would be astonished to see how much
she has to do because we have showers of mail
about board. Lucy sees to the setting of the
tables, and all of us do everything that turns
up to be done. Even Bobby helps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How ridiculous! Well, take care of your
hands, darling. I hate to see a girl with roughened
hands. There is simply no excuse for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen was dazed by her mother&rsquo;s attitude.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She is just presenting a duck-back to
trouble,&rdquo; thought the girl, looking rather ruefully
at her shapely hands which were showing
the inevitable signs of work.</p>

<p><a href="#frontis">She found Douglas sitting in a forlorn heap
in their tent.</a> Her countenance was the picture
of woe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen! Helen! What are we to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad to take a trip to
the White, and you certainly deserve a change.
Poor mumsy, too, is bored to death with such
a long sea trip and she needs some society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, honey, the money!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t see that we need worry so about
that. Mother says that there is not a tradesman
in Richmond who would not be pleased to
have us on his books for any amount. I, for
one, am longing for some new clothes. I don&rsquo;t
mind a bit working and cooking, but I do think
I need some new things&mdash;and as for you&mdash;why,
Douglas, you are a perfect rag bag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas looked at her sister in amazement.
The lesson, then, was not learned yet! She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
thought that Helen understood about the necessity
of making no bills as the bills were what
had helped to reduce their father to this state
of invalidism, but here she was falling into the
mother&rsquo;s way of thinking&mdash;willing to plunge
into debt to any amount.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Dr. Wright&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, always Dr. Wright!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Helen, you know you like Dr. Wright
now and you must trust him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I do. I like him better and trust him entirely
and he himself told me at the station that
father was getting well fast. He said it would
take a little more time but that he would be
perfectly well again&mdash;at least that is what I
gathered. I know father would be the last man
in the world to want his girls to go around
looking like ash cats and you know it would
make him ill indeed to think that mother wanted
to go to White Sulphur for a while and could
not go because of lack of money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it would, but surely neither you
nor mother would tell him that she wanted to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
if you know there is no money to pay for such
a trip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there is money!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen with
some asperity. &ldquo;You told me yourself that the
camp was paying well enough for us to begin
to have quite a bank account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well now, if we have some money you must
think that I have helped to earn it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Helen dear, you have done more than
any of us. You are so capable&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say I have done more, no one could
have worked harder than you have&mdash;in fact,
everybody has worked, but if I have done my
share of the work, then I am certainly entitled to
my share of the money and I intend to take my
share and send mother to White Sulphur for
a change. Of course you will simply have to
go with her as she has set her heart on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; announced Douglas, her girlish
face taking on stern determination.</p>

<p>A shout from Bobby heralded the arrival of
Josephus with the luggage. The discussion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
ended for the time being as Douglas and Helen
were both needed to prepare for the inroad of
week-enders that were to arrive in a few minutes.
Mr. Carter alighted from the cart, already
looking better. He was most enthusiastic
over the camp and all of its arrangements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to be your handy man,&rdquo; he said,
putting his arm around Douglas. &ldquo;Are you
well, honey? You look bothered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I am as well as can be,&rdquo; said Douglas,
trying to smooth her wrinkled brow. How
she did want to talk all the troubles over with
her father, but he of all persons must not be
bothered. The old habit of going to him with
every worry was so strong that it was difficult
to keep from doing it now, but she bit her lips
and held it in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell Lewis,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;He will at
least sympathize.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What was she to do about her mother and
Helen? They seemed to have no more gumption
about money than the birds. Even then parcels
were being carried into the cabin from the cart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
that must have meant much money spent in
New York. Where did mother get it? The
rent from the house in town had been sent to
Mrs. Carter for running expenses on shipboard
and hotels at the many places where they had
stopped, but that must have gone for the trip.
Could she have charged the purchases in New
York? Poor Douglas! She had felt that the
problem of making her sisters see the necessity
of economizing had been a great one, but she
realized that it was nothing to what she must
face now. She felt that all her former arguments
had been in vain since Helen was dropping
into her mother&rsquo;s habit of thought and
upholding that charming butterfly-like person
in all her schemes of extravagance. Lucy was
sure to follow Helen&rsquo;s lead and begin to demand
clothes, treats, trips and what-not. Nan, dear
sensible, unselfish Nan, would be the only one
who would sympathize with her older sister in
regard to the necessity of continuing the strict
economy they had practiced since early in May,
when Dr. Wright had declared that the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
thing that would save their father&rsquo;s reason was
an immediate change, a long rest and complete
cessation of all business worries.</p>

<p>Nan&rsquo;s tastes were simple, but she had a passion
for color and beautiful textiles and sometimes
indulged that taste in adorning her dainty
little person. As a rule, however, she was quite
satisfied to behold the color in a Persian rug
or the wings of a butterfly. Beauty was to
the girl the most important thing in life whether
it was of line, color, sound or idea. She was
perfectly happy with a good book and a comfortable
place in which to curl up. Her fault
was laziness, a certain physical inertia which
her indulgent mother always attributed to her
delicate constitution; but the summer in the
mountains with the enforced activity had proven
that the delicate constitution was due to the
inertia and not the inertia to the delicate constitution.
Up to that time in her life there had
been no especial reason for exerting herself,
but Nan was very unselfish and when she realized
that her sisters were one and all busying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
themselves, she threw off her lazy habits as she
would an ugly robe, and many tasks at Week-End
Camp fell to her share.</p>

<p>Douglas, in this trouble that had arisen, felt
that she could go to Nan for comfort and advice.
Nan&rsquo;s mind was as normally active as her
graceful little body was inactive and she had a
faculty of seeing her way through difficulties
that the conscientious but more slowly thinking
Douglas much envied her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan, it&rsquo;s fifteen minutes before train time
when the week-enders will come piling in&mdash;I&rsquo;m
dying to have a talk with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t die&mdash;just talk,&rdquo; drawled Nan,
looking up from her book but never stopping
turning the crank of the mayonnaise mixer.
This was a job Nan loved, making mayonnaise.
She had gotten it down to a fine art since she
could mix and read at the same time. She declared
it was a plain waste of time to use your
hands without using your head and since turning
a mayonnaise mixer crank required no intelligence
beyond that of seeing that the funnel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
was filled with olive oil, she was able to indulge
in her passion for poetry while she was
making the quarts of mayonnaise that the young
housekeepers dealt out so generously to their
week-enders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen to this!&rdquo; and Nan turned the crank
slowly while she read:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;Alas for all high hopes and all desires!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like leaves in yellow autumn-time they fall&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas for prayers and psalms and love&rsquo;s pure fires&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">One silence and one darkness ends them all!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The crank stopped and all of the oil flowed
through the funnel while Nan softly turned the
leaves of Marston&rsquo;s &ldquo;Last Harvest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, honey, it is beautiful, but you had better
read a livelier form of verse or your salad
dressing will go back on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heavens, you are right! I&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;Barrack
Room Ballads&rsquo; here ready in case I get to
dawdling,&rdquo; laughed Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to talk about something very important,
Nan. Can you turn your crank and
listen?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, but you&rsquo;ll have to talk fast or
else I&rsquo;ll get to poking again. You see, I have to
keep time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Douglas rapidly repeated the conversations
she had had with her mother and later
with Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are we to do? Must I tell Dr. Wright?
I am afraid to get them started for fear father
will be mixed up in it. He must not know
mother wants to go to White Sulphur&mdash;he would
be sure to say let her go and then he would try
to work again before he is fit for it, and he
would certainly get back into the same state
he was in last spring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little mumsy! I was sure she would
not understand,&rdquo; and once more the mixer played
a sad measure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was afraid she wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; sighed Douglas,
&ldquo;but I did think Helen had been taught a lesson
and realized the importance of our keeping
within our earnings and saving something, too,
for winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen&mdash;why, she is too young for the lesson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
she learned to stick. She is nothing but a child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so, grandmother?&rdquo; laughed Douglas,
amused in spite of her trouble at Nan&rsquo;s ancient
wisdom (Nan being some two years younger
than Helen).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Douglas, Helen has just been play-acting
at being poor. She has no idea of its
being a permanency,&rdquo; and Nan filled the funnel
again with oil and began to turn her crank
with vigor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what are we to do? I am not going to
White Sulphur and I am not going to make my
debut&mdash;that&rsquo;s sure. I have never disobeyed
mother that I can remember, but this time I
shall have to. I don&rsquo;t know what I am to say
about the trip to the White. Helen is saying
she has helped to earn the money and she means
to spend her share giving poor mumsy a little
fun after her tiresome long journey on the
water. I wish we had never told her we were
able to put something in the bank last month.
It was precious little and Helen&rsquo;s share would
not keep them at White Sulphur more than two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
or three days. Helen thinks I am stingy and
mother thinks I am stubborn and ugly and sunburned&mdash;and
there&rsquo;s the train with all the week-enders&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
and poor Douglas gave a little
sob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I have turned my wheel until this old
mayonnaise is done&mdash;just look how beautiful it
is! And you, poor old Doug, must just leave it
to me, and I&rsquo;ll think up something to keep them
here if I have to break out with smallpox and
get them quarantined on the mountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nan! Is there some way out of it without
letting father know that mother wants something
and cannot have it for lack of money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure there is! You go powder your nose
and put on a blue linen blouse and give a few
licks to your pretty hair while I hand over the
mayonnaise to Gwen and see that Lucy has
counted noses for the supper tables. I&rsquo;ve
almost got a good reason already for mumsy&rsquo;s
staying here aside from the lack of tin, but I
must get it off to her with great finesse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew you would help!&rdquo; and Douglas gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
her little sister and the mayonnaise bowl an
impartial hug, and then hastened to make herself
more presentable, hoping to find favor in
the eyes of her fastidious mother.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="f8">ROBERT CARTER&rsquo;S ASTONISHING GIRLS</span></h2>


<p>August, the month for holidays, was bringing
much business to the proprietresses of Week-End
Camp. Such a crowd came swarming up
the mountain now that Lucy, who had set the
tables with the assistance of her chum, Lil Tate,
and the two sworn knights, Skeeter Halsey and
Frank Maury, and had carefully counted noses
according to the calculations Nan had made from
the applications she had received, had to do it all
over to make room for the unexpected guests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just kilt-plait the places,&rdquo; suggested Lil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they keep on coming we&rsquo;ll have to accordeon-plait
&rsquo;em,&rdquo; laughed Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, I&rsquo;m glad your eats don&rsquo;t land in your
elbows!&rdquo; from Skeeter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, too!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank. &ldquo;Miss Helen
tipped me a wink that there&rsquo;s Brunswick stew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
made out of the squirrels we got yesterday.
And there is sho&rsquo; no elbow room at these tables.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at &rsquo;em swarming up the mountain.
Where do you reckon they&rsquo;ll sleep?&rdquo; asked Lil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have to roost in the trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bet more than half of them didn&rsquo;t bring
their blankets,&rdquo; hazarded Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the way they do, these town fellows,&rdquo;
said Skeeter, forgetting that he too had
been a town fellow only a few weeks before
that time.</p>

<p>The summer in the mountains was doing wonders
for these youngsters. Sleeping in the open
had broadened their chests. They were wiry
and tanned and every day brought some new
delightful duty that was never called a duty and
so was looked upon by all of them as a great
game. Theirs was the task of foraging for the
camp, and no small job was it to find chickens
and vegetables and fruit for the hungry hordes
that sought the Week-End Camp for holiday
and recreation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>They had found their way to many a remote
mountain cabin and engaged all chickens hatched
and unhatched. They had spread the good news
among the natives that blackberries, huckleberries,
peaches, apples, pears and plums were in
demand at their camp. Eggs were always needed.
Little wild-eyed, tangled-haired children
would come creeping from the bushes, like so
many timid rabbits, bringing their wares; sometimes
a bucket of dewberries or some wild
plums; sometimes honey from the wild bees,
dark and strong and very sweet, &ldquo;bumblebee
honey,&rdquo; Skeeter called it. All was grist that
came to the mill of the week-enders. No matter
how much was provided, there was never
anything to speak of left over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These hyar white folks is same as chickens,&rdquo;
grumbled old Oscar. &ldquo;They&rsquo;s got no notion of
quittin&rsquo; s&rsquo;long as they&rsquo;s any corn lef&rsquo; on the
groun&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They sho&rsquo; kin eat,&rdquo; agreed Susan, &ldquo;but Miss
Douglas an&rsquo; Miss Helen done said we mus&rsquo; fill
&rsquo;em up and that&rsquo;s what we is hyar fur.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>The above is a conversation that, with variations,
occurred during almost every meal at
the camp. Oscar and Susan, the faithful servants
the Carters had brought from Richmond,
were proving more and more efficient now that
the first sting of the country was removed and
camp life had become a habit with them. They
were creatures of habit and imbued with the
notion that what was good enough for white
folks was good enough for them. Their young
mistresses were contented with the life in the
camp, so they were, too. Their young mistresses
were not above doing any work that came
to hand, so they, too, must be willing to do what
fell to their lot. Susan forgot the vows she
had so solemnly sworn when she became a member
of the housemaids&rsquo; league, to do housework
and nothing else. She argued that a camp
wasn&rsquo;t a house and she could do what she chose.
Oscar had, while in town, held himself above any
form of labor not conducive to the dignity of a
butler serving for many years in the best families.
But if Mr. Lewis Somerville and Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Bill Tinsley, both of them belonging to fust
famblies, could skin squirrels, why then, he,
Oscar, must be a sport and skin them, too.</p>

<p>These week-ends in August were hard work
for all concerned and now there was talk of
some of the guests staying over for much longer
and spending two weeks with them. That meant
no cessation of fillin&rsquo; &rsquo;em up. Previous to this
time, Monday had been a blessed day for all
the camp, boarders gone and time to take stock
and rest, but now there was to be no let up in
the filling process.</p>

<p>Susan, for the time completely demoralized
by the return of her beloved mistress, had left
her work to whomsoever it might concern and
had constituted herself lady&rsquo;s maid for Mrs.
Carter. She unpacked boxes and parcels, hovering
over the pretty things purchased in New
York; she fetched and carried for that dainty
lady, ignoring completely the steady stream of
week-enders climbing up the mountain or being
carried up by the faithful and sturdy mountain
goat, with the silent Bill as chauffeur.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Helen had reluctantly torn herself from the
delectable boxes and parcels and was busily engaged
in concocting a wonderful potato salad,
something she always attended to herself. Gwen
was making batter bread after having put to
rise pan after pan of rolls. Oscar had begun
to fry the apples, a dish ever in demand at
camp. The Brunswick stew had been safely deposited
in the fireless cooker early in the day and
all was going well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen, putting the finishing
touch to the last huge bowl of salad and
stepping back to admire her handiwork. &ldquo;That
substantial salad unites beauty and utility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sho&rsquo; do, Miss Helen, it sho&rsquo; do!&rdquo; declared
Oscar, adroitly turning his apples just as they
reached the proper stage of almost and not
quite being candied. &ldquo;They&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; like tater
salid fer contitutioning a foumdation stone on
which to build fillin&rsquo; victuals. It&rsquo;s mo&rsquo; satisfying
to my min&rsquo; than the staft of life itself. All
I is a-hopin&rsquo; is that they won&rsquo;t lick the platter
befo&rsquo; I gits to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You are safe there, Oscar, as I made this
extra dishful to be kept back so you and Susan
will be sure to get some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Susan, indeed!&rdquo; sniffed her fellow-servant.
&ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t called on to expect no favors at yo&rsquo;
han&rsquo;. To be foun&rsquo; by the wayside, a fallin&rsquo;
down wantin&rsquo; jes&rsquo; at this crucible moment!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think she is helping mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;s got nothin&rsquo; to say&mdash;but I &rsquo;low she
helpin&rsquo; yo&rsquo; maw with one han&rsquo; an&rsquo; Susan Jourdan
with yudder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Carter and Dr. Wright looked into the
kitchen a moment. Dr. Wright had been showing
his patient over the camp, as all of the
daughters were occupied. Mr. Carter was delighted
with the arrangements and amazed at
the scope of the undertaking. Could this be his
Helen, the queen of the kitchen, attending to
the preparation of this great quantity of food?
He never remembered before seeing Helen do
any more strenuous work than play a corking
good game of tennis, and here she was handling
a frying pan with the same skill with which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
had formerly handled a racquet, looking after
the apples while Oscar cracked ice and carried
up into the pavilion the great pitchers of cold
tea destined to quench the thirst of the week-enders.</p>

<p>Helen was looking wholly lovely in her becoming
bungalow apron, with her flushed cheeks
and hair a bit dishevelled from the hurry of
getting things done without the assistance of the
capable Susan. Robert Carter looked in amazement
at the great bowls of potato salad and the
pans of rolls, being taken from the oven to
make room for other pans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In heaven&rsquo;s name, what is all this food for?&rdquo;
he asked, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen the week-enders swarming up
the mountain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why yes, but they couldn&rsquo;t eat all this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fool yourself!&rdquo; and Helen gave
her dear father a fried apple hug. She was
very happy. The beloved parents were back
with them. Dr. Wright assured her that her
father was improving. The camp had been her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
very own idea and it was successful. They were
making money and she was going to take her
share of the profits and give her mother a trip.
She, Helen Carter, only eighteen, could do all
of this! She had no idea what the profits
amounted to, but Nan and Douglas had only the
week before congratulated themselves that they
were putting more money in the bank than they
were drawing out. She cared nothing for
money in the bank except as a means of
gratifying the ones she loved. The poor little
mumsy had been shut up on shipboard
for months and surely she deserved some
recreation. She was astonished at Douglas for
being so stingy. It was plain stinginess that
would make her think more of having some
paltry savings than of wanting to give to their
charming, beautiful little mother her heart&rsquo;s
desire, so Helen thought.</p>

<p>Dr. Wright was smiling on her, too. He
seemed to think she was a very remarkable girl,
at least that was what one might gather from
his expression as he stood by the kitchen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
gazed in through the screening at the bright-eyed,
eager young cook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are the other girls?&rdquo; asked Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they have a million things to do! We
always divide up and spread ourselves over the
whole camp when the train gets in. Lucy has
just finished setting the tables, and that is some
job, I can tell you, but Lil Tate and Frank
Skeeter always help. Nan has been making
mayonnaise enough to run us over Sunday, and
now she has gone with Douglas to receive the
week-enders and show them their tents and
cots. Douglas is the great chief&mdash;she does all
the buying and supervising, looks after the comfort
of the week-enders and sees that everything
is kept clean and sanitary. Nan writes all
the letters, and believe me, that is no little task.
She also makes the mayonnaise and helps me
here in the kitchen when I need her, but Gwen
is my right hand man. But what am I thinking
of? You haven&rsquo;t even met Gwen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young English girl was looking shyly at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the big man and thinking what she would give
to have her own father back again. Dr. Wright
had told Mr. Carter of Gwen and her romantic
history, how Helen had found the wallet in the
scrub oak tree containing all of the dead Englishman&rsquo;s
papers, of old Abner Dean&rsquo;s perfidy
in taking the land from Gwen when the receipt
had not been found, although the child was sure
her father had paid for the side of the mountain
before he had built his cabin there. Mr.
Carter had been greatly interested in the recital
and now his kind friendliness brought a
mist to the eyes of the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very glad to know you, my dear. Dr.
Wright has told me of you and now I hope
to be numbered among your friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gwen looked so happy and grateful that
Helen had to give her father one more fried
apple hug before she pushed him out of the
kitchen to make room for the important ceremony
of dishing up supper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did I ever get them, Doctor, these
girls? Why, they are perfect bricks! To think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of my little Helen forgetting the polish on her
fingernails and actually cooking! I don&rsquo;t see
where they came from.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was rather wonderful and George Wright
was somewhat at a loss himself to account for
them as he watched the dainty mother of the
flock trip lightly across the rough mountain
path connecting the cabin with the pavilion.
Robert Carter himself had character enough to
go around, but when one considered that his
character had been alloyed with hers to make
this family it was a wonder that they had that
within them that could throw off tradition and
environment as they had done and undertake
this camp that was proving quite a stupendous
thing for mere girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Dr. Wright,&rdquo; trilled Mrs. Carter,
&ldquo;isn&rsquo;t this a delightful adventure for my girls
to have amused themselves with? The girl of
the day is certainly an enterprising person. Of
course a thing like this must not be carried too
far, as there is danger of their forgetting their
mission in life.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And that mission is&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Being ornaments of society, of course,&rdquo;
laughed the little lady.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter had long ago overcome the fear
she had entertained for the young physician.
He had been so unfailingly kind to her and his
diagnosis of her husband&rsquo;s case had been so
sure and his treatment so exactly right that she
could have nothing but liking and respect for
him. She even forgave him the long exile he
had subjected her to on that stupid ship. It
had cured her Robert and she was willing to
have cut herself off from society for those
months if by doing so she had contributed to
the well-being of her husband. She had been
all devotion and unselfishness in the first agony
of his illness. The habits of her lifetime had
been seemingly torn up by the roots and from
being the spoiled and petted darling she had
turned into the efficient nurse. As his health
returned, however, it had been quite easy to slip
back into her former place of being served instead
of serving. It was as much Robert Carter&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
nature to serve as it was hers to be served.
The habits had not been torn up by the roots,
after all, but only been trimmed back, and now
they were sprouting out with added vigor from
their pruning.</p>

<p>Very lovely the little lady looked in her filmy
lace dress. Her charming face, framed by its
cloud of blue-black hair, showed no trace of
having gone through the anxiety of a severe illness
of one whom she loved devotedly. Nothing
worried her very long and she had the philosophy
of a young child, taking no thought of
the yesterdays or of the morrows. Dr. Wright
looked on her in amazement. Her speaking of
the camp as an adventure chosen by the girls as
something with which to amuse themselves
would have been laughable had it not been irritating
to the young man. And now, forsooth,
their business in life was to become ornaments
of society!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; was all he said, although he had
to turn on his heel and walk off to keep from
asserting that their mission in life should be to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
become useful members of society. He had a
dread of appearing priggish, however, and then
this was Helen&rsquo;s mother and he wanted to do
nothing to mar in any way the friendship that
had sprung up between that elusive young person
and himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are all the children, Robert?&rdquo; asked
Mrs. Carter, wondering in her well-bred mind
why Dr. Wright should be so brusque.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any children, Annette,&rdquo; sighed
Mr. Carter, &ldquo;but I shouldn&rsquo;t sigh but be glad and
happy. Why, they are perfect wonders! Helen
is in the kitchen, not eating bread and honey, but
cooking and bossing, and all the other girls are
flying around taking care of the boarders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boarders! Oh, Robert, what a name to call
them! I can&rsquo;t contemplate it. Who are all
those people I saw coming up the road?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are the boarders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not all that crowd! I thought they had only
a select few.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, they take all that come and I
can tell you they have made the place very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
popular. I did not know they had it in them.
I believe it was a good thing I went off my
hooks for a while, as it has brought out character
in my girls that I did not dream they had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems hardly ladylike for them to be so&mdash;so&mdash;successful
at running a boarding place. I
wonder what people will say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why they will say: &lsquo;Hurrah for the Carter
Girls!&rsquo; At least, that is what the worth-while
people will say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you think it all right, I know it must
be,&rdquo; sighed the poor little lady, &ldquo;but somehow I
think it would be much better for them to have
visited Cousin Elizabeth Somerville until we
got back or had her visit them in Richmond. I
don&rsquo;t at all approve of their renting my house.
Douglas is so coarsened by this living out-of-doors.
She has the complexion that must be
guarded very carefully or she will lose her
beauty very early. I think the summer before
a girl makes her debut should be spent taking
care of her complexion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert Carter laughed. He was always intensely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
amused by his wife&rsquo;s outlook on life and
society and looked upon it as one of her girlish
charms. Common sense had not been what
made him fall in love with her twenty years
before, so the lack of it did not detract in any
way from his admiration of her in these latter
years. She was what she had always been:
beautiful, graceful, sweet, charming; made to be
loved, served and spoiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Bobby? He, at least, cannot be
busy with these awful boarders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bobby? Why, he is now engaged in helping
Josh, the little mountain boy who is serving
as expressman for the girls, to curry Josephus,
the mule. These boarders are not awful, my
dear. You will find many acquaintances among
them. Jeffry Tucker came with his two girls,
the twins, and a friend of theirs from Milton,
Page Allison is her name. There are several
others whom you will be glad to see, I know. I
think it would be well for us to go up in the
pavilion where they dine and then dance, and
you can receive them there as they arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Carter patted her creamy lace dress with
a satisfied feeling that she was looking her best.
It was a new creation from a most exclusive
shop in New York&mdash;quite expensive, but then
she had had absolutely no new clothes for perfect
ages and since the proprietor of the shop
had been most pleased to have her open an account
with him, the price of the gown was no
concern of hers. It set off her pearly skin and
dusky hair to perfection. She was glad Jeffry
Tucker was at the camp. He was a general
favorite in Richmond society and his being there
meant at least that her girls had not lessened
themselves in the eyes of the elite. Surely he
would not bring his daughters to this ridiculous
camp unless he felt that it would do nothing
toward lowering their position.</p>

<p>The pretty, puzzled lady took her place at one
end of the great long dining pavilion as the
week-enders swarmed up the steps, attracted
hither by the odor of fried apples and hot rolls
that was wafted o&rsquo;er the mountainside.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="f8">THE TUCKERS</span></h2>


<p>There had been general rejoicing at Week-End
Camp when Nan had announced that
Jeffry Tucker and his daughters were to come
up for a short stay. The Tuckers were great
favorites and were always received with open
arms at any place where fun was on foot. Mr.
Tucker had written for accommodations for
himself and daughters and their friend, Miss
Allison.</p>

<p>No one would have been more astonished
than Jeffry Tucker, the father of the
Heavenly Twins, at the kind of reputation he
had with a society woman of Mrs. Carter&rsquo;s
standing. For her to think that his bringing
his daughters to the camp meant that he considered
it to their social advantage&mdash;at least not
to their social detriment&mdash;would have convulsed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
that gentleman. He thought no more of the
social standing of his daughters Virginia and
Caroline (Dum and Dee) than he did of the
fourth dimension. He came to the camp and
brought his daughters and Page Allison just
because he heard it was great fun. He had
known Robert Carter all his life and admired
and liked him. His daughters had gone to the
kindergarten and dancing school with Douglas
and Helen and when rumor had it that these
girls were actually making a living with week-end
boarders at a camp in Albemarle, why it was
the most natural thing in the world for the
warm-hearted Jeffry Tucker immediately to
write for tent room for his little crowd.</p>

<p>I hope my readers are glad to see the Tuckers
and Page Allison. The fact of the business is
that they are a lively lot and it is difficult to
keep them in the pages of their own books.
They might have stayed safely there had not
the Carter girls started this venture in the mountains.
That was too much for them. Zebedee
had promised Tweedles again and again to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
them camping, and since what they did Page
must do too, of course she was included in the
promise. This is not their own camp and not
their own book but here they are in it!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Douglas Carter, we think you are the smartest
person that ever was!&rdquo; enthused Dum Tucker
as Douglas showed them to their tent where
three other girls were to sleep, too. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this
just too lovely?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not smart, it&rsquo;s Helen who thought up
this plan,&rdquo; insisted Douglas. &ldquo;We are so glad
you have come and we do hope you will like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like it! We are wild about it,&rdquo; cried Dee,
and Page Allison was equally enthusiastic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Helen?&rdquo; demanded Dum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is chief cook and can&rsquo;t make her appearance
until she has put the finishing touches to
supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she really cook, herself?&rdquo; cried Dee.
&ldquo;How grand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes she cooks herself,&rdquo; drawled Nan,
coming into the tent to see the Tuckers, who
were great favorites with her, too, &ldquo;sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
when we get out of provisions, which we are
liable to do now as six persons have come who
had not written me for accommodations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother and father got here from a long
trip this afternoon,&rdquo; explained Douglas, &ldquo;and
we are so upset over seeing them that we are
rather late. Helen usually does all she has to
do before the week-enders come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us help!&rdquo; begged Dee. &ldquo;Dum and I can
do lots of stunts, and Page here is a wonderful
pie slinger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we would hardly press Miss Allison
into service when she has just arrived,&rdquo; smiled
Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, please don&rsquo;t Miss Allison me! I&rsquo;m
just Page and my idea of camping is cooking,
so if I can help, let me,&rdquo; and Page, who had
said little up to that time, spoke with such genuine
frankness that Douglas and Nan felt somehow
that a new friend had come into their circle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call on all three of you if we need
you,&rdquo; promised Douglas, hastening off with Nan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
to see that other guests had found their tents
and had what they wanted in the way of water
and towels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this great?&rdquo; said Dee. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad
Zebedee thought of coming. I think Douglas
Carter looks healthy but awful bothered, somehow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought so, too. I&rsquo;m afraid her father is
not so well or something. Think of Helen Carter&rsquo;s
cooking!&rdquo; wondered Dum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; asked Page. &ldquo;Is she
so superior?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not that,&rdquo; tweedled the twins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen&rsquo;s fine but so&mdash;so&mdash;stylish. Mrs. Carter
is charming but she is one butterfly and we
always rather expected Helen to be just like
her&mdash;more sense than her mother, but dressy,&rdquo;
continued Dee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will know what Mrs. Carter is, just as
soon as you look at her hands,&rdquo; declared Dum.
&ldquo;If the lilies of the field were blessed with
hands they would look exactly like Mrs. Carter&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, come let&rsquo;s find Zebedee. I smelt apples
frying,&rdquo; and the three friends made their
way to the pavilion where Mrs. Carter was receiving
the week-enders with all the charm and
ceremony she might have employed at a daughter&rsquo;s
debut party.</p>

<p>Her reception of the Tuckers was warm and
friendly. It had been months since she had
seen anyone who moved in her own circle and
now there were many questions to ask of Richmond
society. Jeffry Tucker, who could make
himself perfectly at home with any type, now
laid himself out to be pleasant to his hostess.
He told her all the latest news of Franklin
street and recounted the gossip that had filtered
back from White Sulphur and Warm Springs.
He turned himself into a society column and
announced engagements and rumors of engagements;
who was at the beach and who was at
the mountains. He even made a stagger at the
list of debutantes for the ensuing winter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean that Douglas shall come out next
winter, too,&rdquo; said the little lady during the supper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
that followed. Nan, seeing that her mother
was having such a pleasant time with the genial
Jeffry Tucker, arranged to have the Tuckers
placed at the table that had been set aside for
their mother and father. The Carter girls made
it a rule to scatter themselves through the crowd
the better to look after the hungry and see that
no one&rsquo;s wants were unsatisfied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, is that so? I had an idea she was
destined for college. It seems to me that
Tweedles told me she had passed her Bryn
Mawr exams.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So she did, but I am glad to say she has
given up all idea of that foolishness. I am
very anxious for her to make her debut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan, who was making the rounds of the various
tables to see that everyone was served
properly, overheard her mother&rsquo;s remark and
glanced shyly at Mr. Tucker. She caught his
eye unwittingly but there was something in the
look that he gave her that made her know he
understood the whole situation and was in sympathy
with Douglas, who was very busy at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
next table helping hungry week-enders to the
rapidly disappearing potato salad.</p>

<p>There was a rather pathetic droop to Douglas&rsquo;
young shoulders as though the weight of the
universe were getting a little too much for her.
Mr. Tucker looked from her to Robert Carter
who seemed to be accepting things as he found
them with an astonishing calmness. He was
certainly a changed man. Remembering him as
a person of great force and energy, who always
took the initiative when any work was to be
done or question decided, his old friend wondered
at his almost flabby state. Here he was
calmly letting his silly wife, because silly she
seemed to Jeffry Tucker, although charming and
even lovable, put aside his daughter&rsquo;s desires for
an education and force her into society. He
could see it all with half an eye and what he
could not see for himself the speaking countenance
of the third Carter, Nan, was telling
him as plainly as a countenance could. He determined
to talk with the girl as soon as supper
was over and see if he could help her in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
way, how, he did not know, but he felt that he
might be of some use.</p>

<p>The supper was a very merry one in spite of
the depression that had seized poor Douglas.
She tried not to let her gloom permeate those
around her. Helen was in a perfect gale and
the Tucker Twins took their cue from her and
the ball of good-humored repartee was tossed
back and forth. Tillie Wingo was resplendent
in a perfectly new dancing frock. The beaux
buzzed around her like bees around a honey
pot. The silent Bill Tinsley kept on saying nothing
but his calf eyes were more eloquent than
any words. He had fallen head over heels in
love with the frivolous Tillie from the moment
she offered to tip him on the memorable occasion
of her first visit to the camp. Lewis Somerville,
usually with plenty to say for himself,
was almost as silent as his chum, Bill. It
seemed as though Douglas&rsquo; low spirits had affected
her cousin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Douglas?&rdquo; he whispered, as he
took the last plate of salad from her weary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
hand. &ldquo;You look all done up. Are you sick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed! Nothing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the animals have finished feeding, I
want to talk to you. Can you give me a few
minutes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course, Lewis, as many as you
want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas and Lewis had been friends from
the moment they had met. That had been some
eighteen years before when Douglas had been
crawling on the floor, not yet trusting to her
untried legs, and Lewis, just promoted from
skirts to breeches, had proudly paraded up and
down in front of his baby cousin. There never
had been a problem in Douglas&rsquo; life that she
had not discussed with her friend, but she felt
a delicacy in talking about this trouble that had
arisen on her horizon because it would mean
a certain criticism of both her mother and sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walk after supper?&rdquo; Bill whispered to Tillie.
&ldquo;Something to say.&rdquo; Tillie nodded an assent.</p>

<p>Supper over, the tables and chairs were piled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
up in a twinkling and the latest dance record
put on the Victrola.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, this is delightful!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs.
Carter, looking around for Mr. Tucker to come
claim her for the first dance, but she saw that
gentleman disappearing over the mountainside
with Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan is entirely too young for such nonsense!&rdquo;
she exclaimed with some asperity, but
partners were forthcoming a-plenty so she was
soon dancing like any girl of eighteen, while her
indulgent husband smoked his pipe and looked
contentedly on.</p>

<p>Susan and Oscar washed the dishes with
more rattling than usual as Oscar had much
grumbling in store for the delinquent Susan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wherefo&rsquo; you done lef&rsquo; yo&rsquo; wuck to Miss
Helen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;s a-helpin&rsquo; Mis&rsquo; Carter. She kep&rsquo; me a-openin&rsquo;
boxes an&rsquo; hangin&rsquo; up things. I knowed
Miss Helen wouldn&rsquo;t min&rsquo;. She thinks her maw
oughter have what she wants. I done heard
her tell Miss Douglas that she means to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
her maw has her desires fulfilled. Sounded
mos&rsquo; lak qua&rsquo;llin&rsquo; the way the young missises
was a-talkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all I got to say is that Mis&rsquo; Carter
ain&rsquo;t called on to git any mo&rsquo; waitin&rsquo; on than
the young ladies. They&rsquo;s as blue-blooded as
what she is an&rsquo; even mo&rsquo; so as they is got all
the blood she&rsquo;s got an&rsquo; they paw&rsquo;s beside. I
bet she ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to tun a han&rsquo; to fill any of
these folks up. There she is now a-dancin&rsquo;
&rsquo;round like a teetotaller a-helpin&rsquo; the boarders
to shake down they victuals. I&rsquo;ll be boun&rsquo; some
of these here Hungarians will be empty befo&rsquo;
bed time.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="f8">POSTPRANDIAL CONVERSATIONS</span></h2>


<p>It was a wonderful night. The sun had set
in a glory of clouds while Oscar was still endeavoring
to fill &rsquo;em up. The moon was full
and &ldquo;round as the shield of my fathers.&rdquo; It
was very warm with not a breeze stirring.
Jeffry Tucker drew Nan down on the first fallen
log they came to out of reach of the noise
from the pavilion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is fine to be able to leave the city for a
while,&rdquo; he said, drawing in deep breaths of
mountain air. &ldquo;And now, Miss Nan Carter,
I want you to tell me what was the reason for
the S.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;S. that you sent out to me as plain
as one pair of eyes can speak to another. I
am a very old friend of your father, have known
him ever since I was a little boy at school where
I looked up to him and admired him as only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
a little boy can a big one. I see he is in poor
health, at least in a nervous state, and I am
wondering if there isn&rsquo;t something I can do.
I don&rsquo;t want to butt in&mdash;you understand that,
don&rsquo;t you? But if I can help, I want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then Nan Carter did just exactly what
everybody always did: she took Jeffry Tucker
into her confidence and told him all of the troubles
of the family. He listened attentively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see! The rent from the house in Richmond
is the only income you can depend upon
just now, and your mother wants to live at
home again and have Miss Douglas make her
debut in state. She has given up college for lack
of funds, but she is to make her debut instead&mdash;a
much more expensive pastime, I fancy. What
does your father say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is the terrible part of it! We
don&rsquo;t want anyone to appeal to father&mdash;he is
sure to say that mother must do just as she
chooses. He always has said that and he thinks
that he is put on earth just to gratify mother&rsquo;s
every wish. Mr. Tucker, please don&rsquo;t think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
mother is selfish&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t that&mdash;she is just inexperienced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not! Certainly not!&rdquo; But that
gentleman crossed his fingers and quickly possessed
himself of a bit of green leaf, which
was the Tucker twins&rsquo; method, as children,
when they made a remark with a mental reservation,
the remark for politeness and the mental
reservation for truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, if father begins to think that mother
wants things that it will take more money to
buy, he will go back to work, and Dr. Wright
says that nothing but a complete rest will cure
him&mdash;rest and no worries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Dr. Wright have a plain talk with your
mother and explain matters to her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye-e-s, but there is a kind of complication
there, too. You see, Dr. Wright had a horrid
time at first trying to beat it into us that father
was in a bad way. Helen kicked against his
diagnosis like I don&rsquo;t know what, treated Dr.
Wright mighty badly. He was fine about it
and so patient that by and by Helen came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
her senses, and began to appreciate all he had
done for father, and she and Dr. Wright are
real good friends. Now Helen is siding with
mother and thinks that whatever mother wants
to do she should do. She even wants Douglas
to go to White Sulphur with mother for several
weeks, right now in our very busiest season.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Tucker could not help laughing at the
child by his side, so seriously discussing the
trials of her family and now talking about their
busiest season like some veteran hotel keeper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;White Sulphur would mean an added expense,
too,&rdquo; he suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, and Helen says she will take her
share of the summer&rsquo;s earnings and send
mother. Helen is very generous and very impulsive,
with no more idea of saving for winter
than a grasshopper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is what I take it you want me to do:
make your mother change her mind about going
to White Sulphur and decide of her own accord
that this winter it would be a mistake to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Miss Douglas out to make her bow before Richmond
society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly! Oh, Mr. Tucker, if you only could
without having father even know that mother
is not having everything she wants!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best. I may have to take Dr.
Wright into consultation before I get through.
Already a plan is surging in my brain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s fly back to the pavilion then and you
start to work!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan forgot to be shy in her eagerness to
thank Mr. Tucker for his interest in their affairs
and her hurry to get him launched in the
undertaking of coercing her mother without
that little lady&rsquo;s knowledge. She wondered if
she had spoken too plainly about Dr. Wright
and Helen. Nan was sentimental, as one of her
poetic nature would be apt to be, and the budding
romance that she thought she could spy
springing up between Dr. Wright and her sister,
far be it from her to blight. She felt sure
Dr. Wright would feel it to be his duty to protect
his patient from mental worry, but she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
was also sure that Helen would be quite impatient
if Dr. Wright ventured to criticize her
mother. What a relief it was to have unbosomed
herself to this dear, kind Mr. Tucker, who
understood her so readily and still did not seem
to think her poor little mother was selfish or
silly! (The crossing of fingers and holding
something green had escaped her notice.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell Douglas I have said anything to
him,&rdquo; she promised herself. &ldquo;It would be difficult
to explain that I caught his eye at the
supper table and he divined that I was in trouble.
That is the truth, though, no matter how
silly it sounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She wondered what the plan was that had
begun to surge but she determined to leave it
to Mr. Tucker. That gentleman, whatever his
idea of attack, did not immediately approach
her mother but made his way to the middle of
the pavilion where he awaited his chance to
break in on a dance with Page Allison, his
daughters&rsquo; friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She may be part of his plan! Who knows?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
At any rate, I believe he is going to get us out
of the trouble somehow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Douglas and Lewis left the pavilion they
took the path straight up the mountain. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
go this way and shake the crowd for a little
while,&rdquo; suggested Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we mustn&rsquo;t be long. Helen will have
too much entertaining to do. We can&rsquo;t get it
out of our heads that we must treat these boarders
as though we were having a house-party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon that&rsquo;s the reason you have
been so successful. I have heard some of the
fellows say that they never hear the chink of
coin here. It really seems like a house-party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so glad, but I am glad of the chink of
coin, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Douglas, I did not bring you out here
to talk about boarders and coin&mdash;I have got
something else to say. Bill and I have just been
waiting until Cousin Robert and Cousin Annette
got back because we couldn&rsquo;t leave you without
any protection&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave us! Oh, Lewis!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mind really, Douglas?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mind? Why, I can&rsquo;t tell you how much I
mind!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know we have no business staying here
indefinitely and we feel we must get to work.
We are going to enlist for the Mexican border.
We have got over our grouch against Uncle
Sam for firing us from West Point and now
that he needs us, we are determined to show
him we are ready to serve him in any capacity.
You know we are right, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye-e-s, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>By that time Lewis had taken possession of
Douglas&rsquo; hands and with a voice filled with emotion,
he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to leave you, but now Cousin
Robert is here he will make it safe for you.
I have tried to help some&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, and you have! We couldn&rsquo;t have done
a thing without you and Bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. I believe there is
no limit to what you Carter girls can do&mdash;but,
Douglas&mdash;honey&mdash;before I go to Mexico&mdash;I&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
just have to tell you how much I love you.
I don&rsquo;t mean like a cousin&mdash;I&rsquo;m not such close
kin to you after all&mdash;I mean I love you so much
that the thought of leaving you is agony. You
knew all the time that it was no cousin business,
didn&rsquo;t you, Douglas?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Lewis, I never thought of such a
thing. You are almost like my brother,&rdquo; and
Douglas devoutly wished the moon would hurry
up and get behind a big black cloud that was
coming over the mountain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brother much! I&rsquo;m not the least little bit
like a brother. Bill&rsquo;s got sisters and I don&rsquo;t
believe he is bothering about leaving them one-tenth
as much as he is leaving Tillie Wingo.
Why, honey, ever since I can remember I have
been meaning to get you to marry me when we
both grew up. Of course, I can&rsquo;t ask you to
marry me now as I haven&rsquo;t a piece of prospect
and will have to enlist in the ranks and work up,
but I mean to work up fast and be so steady that
I&rsquo;ll be a lieutenant before Carranza and Villa
can settle their difficulty. Won&rsquo;t you be engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
to me so I&rsquo;ll have something to work for
until I can see you again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Engaged to you! Why, Lewis, I&mdash;I&mdash;how
can I be when it is so sudden? You never told
me before that you cared for me the least little
bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Told you before! Ye Gods and little fishes!
I&rsquo;ve been telling you for pretty near eighteen
years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I never heard you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you say you don&rsquo;t give a hang
for me and let me go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Lewis, I give a whole lot of hangs for
you and I don&rsquo;t want you to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know the kind of hangs you give:
just this brother and sister business,&rdquo; and the
young man dropped the girl&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>Douglas felt like crying, but Lewis was so
absurd she had to laugh. What time had she
to think about getting engaged? She felt as
though the whole world rested on her young
shoulders. Here was her mother wanting her
to make a debut, and Helen wanting to spend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
on a silly trip the pitiful little money they had
begun to save from their boarding camp. And
now Lewis Somerville and Bill Tinsley, the
brawn and sinew of their undertaking, suddenly
deciding that they must enlist and hike out for
the Mexican border!</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must go back to the pavilion,&rdquo; she said
wearily. Her voice sounded very tired and she
stumbled a little as she turned to go down the
path.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Douglas, I have distressed you,&rdquo; and
Lewis was all thoughtfulness and consideration.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to, honey&mdash;I just want you to say
you love me the way I love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t say it, because I never thought
of your caring for me in any different way.
You are the best friend I have in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that is something and I am going to
keep on being it. Maybe when I come back
from Mexico you will think differently. You
will write to me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course I will, Lewis! Haven&rsquo;t I
always written to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Douglas, don&rsquo;t you think you could love me
a little?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Lewis, I do love you a whole lot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I mean be engaged to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lewis Somerville, would you want me to be
engaged to you when you know perfectly well
that I have never thought of you except as the
very best friend I&rsquo;ve got in the world, and if
not as a brother, at least as a cousin who has
been almost like a brother? If I did engage
myself to you, you wouldn&rsquo;t have the least bit
of respect for me and you know you wouldn&rsquo;t;
would you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Lewis would not answer. He just drew
her arm in his and silently led her back to the
pavilion. The big cloud had made its way in
front of the moon and he took advantage of
the darkness to kiss her hand, but he was very
gentle and seemingly resigned to the brother
business that he had so scorned. His youthful
countenance was very sad and stern, however,
as he turned and made his way to the tent that
he shared with Bill and Bobby.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Bill Tinsley and Tillie Wingo, too, were walking
on the mountainside, Bill as silent as the
grave but in a broad grin while Tillie kept up
her accustomed chatter. It flowed from her rosy
lips with no more effort than water from a
mountain spring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Mr. Tinsley, that I have danced
out five dresses this summer? As for shoes!
If Helen had not given me some of her slippers,
I would be barefooted this minute. I don&rsquo;t
mind this rough dressing in the day time, but
I must say when evening comes I like to doll
up. I believe Mrs. Carter feels the same way.
Isn&rsquo;t that a lovely dress she has on this evening?
There is no telling what it cost. If
their mother can buy such a frock as that, I
think it is absurd for the girls to be working so
hard&mdash;and believe me, they are some workers.
Now, I&rsquo;m real practical and know how to dress
on very little and, if I do say it that shouldn&rsquo;t,
I bet there is not a girl in Richmond who makes
a better appearance on as little money as I
spend, but I know what things cost&mdash;you can&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
fool me&mdash;and I&rsquo;m able to tell across the room
that that filmy lace effect that Mrs. Carter is
sporting set her back a good seventy-five.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; from Bill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy, seventy-five, I say, and maybe more!
It would take a lot of week-enders to pay for
it and I bet she no more thinks about it than
she does about the air she breathes. Now she
wants to bring Douglas out and you know she
wouldn&rsquo;t be willing to let her come out like a
poor girl&mdash;no sirree! Douglas would have to
have all kinds of clothes and all kinds of parties.
She would have to come out in a blaze
of glory if her mother has a finger in it.
Girls who come out that way don&rsquo;t have
such a lot on the ones who just quietly
crawl out&mdash;like I did, f&rsquo;instance. I just quietly
crawled&mdash;you could not call it coming&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Bill gave one of his great laughs, breaking
his vow of silence. At least it seemed as
though he must have made such a vow as
through all of Tillie&rsquo;s chatter he had uttered
not one word more than the &ldquo;Whew&rdquo; over Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Carter&rsquo;s extravagance. The picture of Tillie&rsquo;s
quietly crawling got the better of his risibles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t laugh! I can assure you I
came out in home-made clothes and during the
entire winter I had not one thing done for me
to push me in society&mdash;not a cup of tea was
handed in my name. One lady did put my card
in some invitations she got out, trying to relaunch
a daughter who had been out for three
seasons and gone in again, but she had an inconvenient
death in the family and had to recall
the invitations; so I got no good of it after
all. Not that I cared&mdash;goodness no! I had
all the fun there was to have and I&rsquo;m still having,
although I&rsquo;m not able to keep in the swim,
giving entertainments and what not. Of course,
I was not included in select luncheons and dinner
dances and the like. Those expensive blowouts
are given with a view of returning all
kinds of obligations or of putting people in your
debt so you are included in theirs&mdash;but I got
to all the big things and got there without the
least wire-pulling or working. Of course, I did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
get to some of the small things because I was
run in a lot as substitute when some girl dropped
out. I wasn&rsquo;t proud and did not mind in the
least being second or third choice. People who
never entertain need not expect to be on the
original list. I just took a sensible view of the
matter. I tell you, if a girl wants to have a
good time she&rsquo;s got no business with a chip on
her shoulder. Society is a give-and-take game
and if you are poorish and want to get without
giving, you&rsquo;ve got to be willing to do a lot in
the way of swallowing your pride. At least,
I had no slights offered me where the dancing
men were concerned. I made every german and
that is something many a rich debutante can&rsquo;t
say for herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tillie paused for breath and then Bill opened
his mouth to speak, but the loquacious Tillie got
in before he could begin and he had to wait.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I believe Douglas would have lots of
attention even if her mother did nothing to
help on, but Mrs. Carter would enjoy having a
daughter in society more than a daughter would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
enjoy being there, I believe, and she would be
entertaining and spending money from morning
until night. Of course, Lewis Somerville would
be lots of help as he would stand ready to take
Douglas anywhere that she did not get a bid
from some other man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Lewis&rsquo;ll be gone,&rdquo; broke in Bill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone! Nonsense! Now that he is out of
West Point I&rsquo;ll be bound he will just dance
attendance on Douglas. He is dead gone on her.
That helps a lot in a girl&rsquo;s first year: to have a
devoted&mdash;that is, if he is not silly jealous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mexican border!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he is out of soldiering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both of us enlisting!&rdquo; Tillie was absolutely
silenced for a moment and Bill went on: &ldquo;See
here, Miss Wingo, Tillie! I&rsquo;d be glad if you
would&mdash;if&mdash;I&rsquo;m stuck on you for sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come off! You know you think I&rsquo;m the
silliest ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are about the prettiest, jolliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
ever. I wish you would let me go off to Mexico
engaged to you. It would make it lots easier to
work and I mean to work like a whole regiment
and make good. Won&rsquo;t you, Tillie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care if I do. You are a fine
dancer and I think a heap of you, Bill. I&rsquo;d
rather keep it dark, though, if you don&rsquo;t mind,
as it queers a girl&rsquo;s game sometimes if she gets
engaged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord, no! I don&rsquo;t mind just so I know it
myself,&rdquo; and the happy Bill enfolded his enamorata
in his arms, although she carefully admonished
him not to crush her new dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never dreamed you were thinking about
me seriously,&rdquo; she confessed as she emerged
from his embrace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honest? Been dotty about you ever since
you took me for a jitney driver and tipped me a
quarter. Got it yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look how dark it is! I believe we are going
to have a storm. What a great black cloud!
Let&rsquo;s hurry, as I have no idea of getting my
frock wet.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Hurry they did and reached the pavilion just
as great drops began to fall. Bill was in a state
of happy excitement over his engagement, although
it was something he must keep to himself.
He felt like shouting it on the housetops,
but instead he gave one of his great laughs
that startled Mrs. Carter so she stopped dancing
and hunted up Bobby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sounded like bears and lions,&rdquo; she declared,
&ldquo;and I felt uneasy about my baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She found that youngster fast asleep cuddled
up in his father&rsquo;s arms, the father looking very
happy and peaceful. Robert Carter felt quite
like a little child himself with his great girls
taking care of him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="f8">THE STORM</span></h2>


<p>That storm was always known as &ldquo;The
Storm&rdquo; by everyone who was at the Week-End
Camp on that night in August. Greendale had
been singularly free from severe storms that
season and the Carters had had no difficulty
up to that time in keeping dry. They had had
rain in plenty but never great downpours and
their mountain had escaped the lightning that
on several occasions had played havoc not many
miles from them.</p>

<p>The day had been exceptionally warm but
very clear. The full moon had taken the place
of the sun when night came on and so brilliant
was the glow from that heavenly orb, one
could almost fancy heat was reflected as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
as light. The great black cloud that came rolling
over the mountain was as much an astonishment
to the dancers in the pavilion as it was
to the moon herself. They refused to recognize
the fact that a storm was coming up and the
moon also held her own for some time after
the downpour was upon them. She kept peeping
out through rifts in the clouds and once
when the storm was at its fiercest she sailed clear
of all clouds for a few moments, and then it
was that the rarest of all beauties in Nature
was beheld by the damp and huddled-up crowd
of week-enders: a lunar rainbow.</p>

<p>It stretched across the valley, a perfect arc
with the colors as clearly defined as a solar
bow but infinitely more delicate than any rainbow
ever beheld before.</p>

<p>There was no such thing as keeping dry.
When Lewis Somerville and Bill Tinsley built
the pavilion, they had kept exactly to the architect&rsquo;s
plans, drawn so carefully by Robert Carter&rsquo;s
assistant, Mr. Lane. The roof projected
so far on every side that they had remarked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the time that nothing short of horizontal rain
could find its way under that roof. Well, this
rain was horizontal and it came in first one direction
and then another until every bit of floor
space was flooded. The thunder sounded like
stage thunder made by rolling barrels of bricks
down inclined planes and helped out with the
bass drum. Great clouds rested on the mountain
tops and a wind, that seemed demoniacal
in the tricks it played, bent over great forest
trees as though they were saplings and then let
them snap back into place with a deafening
crack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Save the Victrola,&rdquo; whispered Tillie to Bill.
&ldquo;I want to dance with you once before you go
off, and water will ruin it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was enough for the devoted Bill. He
took off his coat and wrapped it tenderly over
the top of the Victrola, which was still playing
a gay dance tune as no one had had the presence
of mind to stop it. Then he made a dash
for the kitchen just as a river of water was
descending and in a twinkling was back bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
in his arms a great tin tub. This he placed
over the top of the precious music-maker. He
felt very tender toward Tillie just then for although
her new dress was being ruined, still her
first thought had been for the Victrola so she
could dance with him.</p>

<p>The storm having come up so suddenly found
the crowd totally unprepared. Tent flys had
been left up and the windows and door of the
cabin, where Mrs. Carter was installed, were
wide open for the four winds of heaven to
blow through. Sad havoc they played with the
dainty finery that Mrs. Carter and Susan had
left spread out on the bed. The wonderful hat,
brought as a present for Douglas, was picked
up the next morning half way down the mountain;
at least the ruin was supposed to be that
hat but it was never quite identified as it had
lost all semblance to a hat.</p>

<p>Lewis, after hearing the ultimatum from
Douglas, as I have said, made his solitary way
to his tent where he threw himself on his cot to
fight it out with his disappointed self. A dash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of rain on his tent aroused him and then a
mighty gust of wind simply picked up the tent
and wafted it away like thistledown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but Lewis never finished of
all the what, but in a twinkling he had rolled up
the bed clothes belonging to himself and his tent
mates, and then rushing to the neighboring tents
that were still withstanding the raging hurricane
he rolled up blankets found there and
piled cots on top of the bundles.</p>

<p>It was a real fight, strong man that he was,
to make his way to the pavilion. Trees were
bending before the wind and he found the only
way to locomote was to crawl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just suppose the pavilion doesn&rsquo;t hold!&rdquo; was
ringing in his mind; but the young men &ldquo;had
builded better than they knew.&rdquo; It did hold
although the roof was straining at the rafters
and Lewis and Bill feared every moment it
might rise up and float off as their tent had
done.</p>

<p>Lewis came under cover wetter than he would
have been had he been in swimming, he declared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Swimming just soaks the water in but the rain
had beat it in and hammered it down. The
wind was still driving the rain in horizontal
sheets and the pavilion was getting damper and
damper. The week-enders were a very forlorn
looking crowd and no doubt the majority of
them were far from blessing the day that had
brought them to the camp in Albemarle. They
ran from corner to corner trying to get out of
the searching flood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know they are blaming it on us!&rdquo; cried
Nan to Mr. Tucker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is blaming it on you?&rdquo; laughed Page
Allison. &ldquo;Why, honey, it may be doing worse
things in other places. We should be thankful
we are on a mountain top instead of in a valley.&rdquo;
Then she drew Mr. Tucker aside and
whispered to him: &ldquo;See here, Zebedee, don&rsquo;t
you think it is up to us somehow to relieve this
situation? If we get giddy and act as though
it were a privilege to be wet to the skin, don&rsquo;t
you think we might stir up these people and
make a lark of this storm instead of a calamity?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
You remember you told me once that you and
Miss Jinny Cox saved the day for a picnic at
Monticello when a deluge hit you there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zebedee was the Tucker Twins&rsquo; pet name for
their father, and Page Allison, their best friend,
was also privileged to use the name for that
eternally youthful gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking we must do something,
but the lightning is so severe that somehow I
think I must wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are like Mammy Susan who says:
&rsquo;Whin the Almighty is a-doing his wuck ain&rsquo;t
the time fur a po&rsquo; ole nigger ter be a-doin&rsquo;
hern.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly! But it is letting up a bit now, that
is, the lightning is, but the rain is even more terrific.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A great crash of thunder, coming simultaneously
with a flash of lightning that cracked like
a whip, put a stop to conversation, and Page,
in spite of her bravery, for she was not the
least afraid of storms as a rule&mdash;clung to Mr.
Tucker. Everybody was clinging to everybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
else and in the stress of the moment no one
was choosy about the person to cling to. Bill
cursed his stars that Tillie was hanging on to
Skeeter, as pale as a little ghost, when she might
just as well be hanging on to him, while he, in
turn, was supporting a strange person he had
never even met.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That hit close to us!&rdquo; exclaimed someone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe it hit me!&rdquo; screamed a girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are Susan and Oscar?&rdquo; cried Douglas.
&ldquo;They will be scared to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I went down in the kitchen after the
tub for the Victrola, Oscar was under the table
and Susan was trying to get in the fireless
cooker, head first,&rdquo; volunteered Bill. &ldquo;The
kitchen is really the dryest place on the mountain,
I fancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget the shower bath,&rdquo; suggested
Helen. &ldquo;Turn it on full force and it would still
be a thousand times dryer than any place
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you what let&rsquo;s do!&rdquo; spoke Dum Tucker
with an inspiration that all regretted had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
come sooner. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s climb up and sit on the
rafters!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suiting the action to the word, she lightly ascended
the trunk of the huge tulip poplar tree
that had been left in the center of the pavilion
as a support to the roof. The branches had
been sawed off, leaving enough projecting to
serve as hat racks for the camp. These made
an admirable winding stair which an athletic
girl like Dum Tucker made nothing of climbing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; and Dee Tucker followed her
twin. In short order many of the more venturesome
members of the party were perched
on the rafters where they defied the rain to reach
them. Even poor Mrs. Carter, her pretty lace
dress, if not absolutely ruined, at least with all
of its first freshness gone, was persuaded to
come up, too, and there she sat trembling and
miserable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on up, Page!&rdquo; shouted Dee to her
chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there soon,&rdquo; but Page had an idea
that she meant first to propose to Douglas.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Poor Douglas, this was a fitting ending to a
day of worry and concern. She felt like one</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Whom unmerciful disaster<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Followed fast and followed faster.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Of course country folk are always made to
feel in some intangible way that they are responsible
for the weather when the weather
happens to be bad and city folk are visiting
them. Douglas thought she had enough not to
bear the weight of the storm, but somehow she
felt that that, too, was added to her burden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know exactly what you are thinking,&rdquo; said
Page, coming up and putting her wet arm
around Douglas&rsquo; wet waist. &ldquo;I have lived in
the country all my life and whenever we have
a big storm at Bracken or unseasonable weather
of any sort, we are always held personally responsible
for it by a certain type of visitors.
You think this is going to harm your camp and
keep people from coming, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how did you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little bird told me&mdash;a stormy petrel. Now
I tell you what we must do: we must whoop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
things up until all of these week-enders will
think that the storm was about the most interesting
thing that ever happened at Camp Carter
and they will come again hoping for a repetition
of the experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Page! How can we?&rdquo; and Douglas
smiled in spite of herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s call a council and appoint a committee
on ways and means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Tucker was first on the list, then Helen
and Dr. Wright, Bill Tinsley and Lewis Somerville.
Nan was so busy looking at the beauties
of Nature that she had to be called three
times before she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, Miss Nan!&rdquo; begged Mr. Tucker.
&ldquo;Your wise little head is wanted on this committee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only look at that bank of clouds as the
lightning strikes on the edge of it! It looks
like the portals of heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it came mighty near being that
same thing,&rdquo; muttered Mr. Tucker.</p>

<p>The storm was really passing. Flashes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
lightning and peals of thunder grew farther
and farther apart. The rain gave one big last
dash and stopped as suddenly as it had begun
and then the moon asserted herself once more.</p>

<p>Every member of the hastily called council
had some suggestion to make and every suggestion
was eagerly taken by the committee on
ways and means, that committee being composed
of the entire council.</p>

<p>Page said hot coffee for the entire camp must
be made immediately and she would do the
making. Dr. Wright said a fire would be a
pretty good thing if it could be managed, and
Bill Tinsley remembered some charcoal braziers
that Susan used for ironing and a box of charcoal
in the corner of the kitchen. Lewis went
to gather up all the blankets in the camp and
those that were damp were draped along the
rafters by the climbers. Soon the brazier had
a glow of coals that sent up heat to the rafters,
and Bill also put into use the great iron pot
that had hung over the camp fire just for picturesqueness.
It had never had anything in it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
but water, all the cooking being done on kerosene
stoves and in a fireless cooker. This made
an excellent brazier and the coals were kept
red hot with the help of the automobile tire
pump in lieu of bellows. Helen had ambition
for a welsh rarebit and started in with chafing
dishes. This called into requisition more workers
and all of the camp was soon busy cutting
up cheese and toasting bread and crackers.</p>

<p>The Victrola was relieved of its tub and a
ragtime record put on that made all of the
workers step lively, which did much toward
starting their circulation and warming them up
generally. The Victrola ever after that was
called Diogenes, after a certain wise man who
lived in a tub.</p>

<p>Everybody danced at his work and everybody
was laughing and happy. The moonlight
was so dazzling in its brilliancy that it was difficult
to realize that not ten minutes before the
biggest storm Greendale had ever known had
been making even the strong men tremble.
Nan seemed to be the only person who had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
been afraid. Even those who had never before
minded a storm had been cowed by this one.</p>

<p>Page declared she had always liked storms
before; even when a big gum tree on the lawn
at Bracken had been struck before her very
eyes she had not been afraid, but this time she
was scared to death.</p>

<p>Dum said it seemed to be such a personal
storm somehow and each flash seemed to mean
her. &ldquo;I felt my naked soul was exposed to my
Maker,&rdquo; she said, as she gave her beloved father
a hug. &ldquo;I have got all kinds of things to
&rsquo;fess to you, Zebedee, things that I never
thought made any difference before,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Dumdeedledums! What on earth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only this evening I smoked a cigarette, although
I know you hate it&mdash;I owe a little bill
for soda water at Miller&rsquo;s, although I know you
don&rsquo;t want me to charge things&mdash;there are other
things but I can&rsquo;t think of them just now. Suppose&mdash;only
suppose that I had winked out without
telling you or worse than that, suppose you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
had&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but Dum couldn&rsquo;t finish for the big
tears that rolled out of her eyes and which
Tucker-like she made no attempt to conceal.
Zebedee lent her his handkerchief and then had
to wipe his own eyes, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all right, honey, but don&rsquo;t do it any
more. And now you turn in and help these
Carter girls and Page jolly up this crowd. Page
is making coffee and I am going with Somerville
to right the tents and take stock of the damage
done by the storm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Page had first entered the kitchen she
found the two negroes bent over in abject woe.
Oscar was praying while Susan moaned and
groaned with occasional ejaculations like a
Greek chorus in a tragedy of Euripides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh my Gawd, let the deep waters pass over
me and let me come out whiter than the snow
and sweeter than the honey in the honey comb&mdash;let
me be putrified by fire and let the rollin&rsquo;
thunder&rsquo;s shock pass me by, leavin&rsquo; me stand
steadfast, a pillar of smoke by day and a pillar
of fire by night like unto a lily of the valley, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
bright an&rsquo; mawnin&rsquo; star that casts its beams on
the jest an&rsquo; the onjest&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Gawd!&rdquo; wailed the chorus. &ldquo;An&rsquo;
the jest an&rsquo; the onjest shall lie down together
like the lion an&rsquo; the lamb in that great an&rsquo;
mighty day an&rsquo; who Gawd has united let no
man pull acinder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes! In that day when the Rock of
Ages shall smite the Shibboleth and the Urum
an&rsquo; Thurum may be delivered not&mdash;remember
thou thy servant Oscar&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes, Lord! an&rsquo; thy handy maiden
Susan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Page entered and put a stop to the impassioned
appeal by asking for the coffee pot, while
Bill Tinsley bore off the big brazier full of charcoal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The storm is over, I think,&rdquo; said Page, with
difficulty restraining her smiles. &ldquo;It was very
terrible indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turrible ain&rsquo;t no word for it; an&rsquo; now you
say the white folks wants to eat agin? Lord
love us if ev&rsquo;thing don&rsquo;t make these here week-enders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
emptier an&rsquo; emptier. Feedin&rsquo; of them
is like pourin&rsquo; water down a rat hole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, uncle, they all of them got
so wet that it is wise to give them something
hot to drink, and then, too, we want them to
forget the terrible storm and think of the camp
only with pleasure. You see they might not
come back again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forget it! forget it! You can&rsquo;t lose these
here folks. They&rsquo;d ride all the way from Richmond
jes&rsquo; to fill theyselves up, if for no other
reason. They is the empties&rsquo; lot I ever come
acrost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dee Tucker followed Page to the kitchen to
see if she could be of any assistance in making
the coffee. She felt keenly sorry for the Carters
on account of this storm. Not being connected
with them in any way, the grumblers
had not hesitated to criticize the whole thing
in Dee&rsquo;s presence when they got wet and scared.
Dee had done all in her power to soften their
judgment, but there were several who did not
hesitate to blame the Carter girls because of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
wetting. Nothing is so catching as criticism
and it spreads like wildfire with the genus
boarder. She told Page of her fears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to put a stop to it. You get Tillie
Wingo and you and she soft soap the men
who are grouching, and then get Zebedee to go
after the females. He can make them believe
they only dreamed it stormed.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="f8">THE DAMAGE DONE</span></h2>


<p>Jeffry Tucker and his daughter Caroline,
otherwise known as Dee, were surely the most
tactful human beings in the world. They could
almost always gain any goal by tact. They
set out now to make the grouchy week-enders
dry up and cheer up, and in half an hour after
the storm was over they had attained their object.
Page overheard Mr. Tucker pacifying a
very disconsolate maiden lady whose hair had
come out of curl and whose rosy cheeks had
run off&mdash;not far, however&mdash;only to her jaws.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a most outrageous way to treat
boarders!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;The idea of having
no proper shelter for them&mdash;charging an enormous
price, too! I certainly intend to leave
tomorrow and I will stop some friends of mine
who were planning to come up next week. Isn&rsquo;t
it strange how these places are overrated? Anyhow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
I&rsquo;ll not give it a good name but will get
out the first thing in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; begged the wily Zebedee.
&ldquo;I had planned to get you to take a walk with
me tomorrow evening. The moon will be gorgeous
and there are some wonderful spots
around here&mdash;romantic spots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of course I wouldn&rsquo;t think of going if
it clears up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has already cleared up! Just look at the
moon! I almost think we might take a walk now,
but it might be very muddy. Let&rsquo;s fox trot instead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Done, for a ducat!&rsquo;&rdquo; laughed Page to herself,
as Mr. Tucker and the much mollified
week-ender danced off together. &ldquo;I am afraid
poor Zebedee will have his whole holiday taken
up showing the moon to wet hens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What Mr. Tucker accomplished with the females,
Tillie and Dee did likewise to the males.
Tillie exercised all her fascinations on some
hallroom boys, while Dee went in for some old
bachelors who loved their ease and comfort and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
did not at all relish the idea of wet sheets on
soggy cots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is some hot coffee!&rdquo; she said, with a
very winning smile. &ldquo;Two lumps, or one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None for me, miss,&rdquo; from a terrible old
grouch who had been particularly loud in his
praise of Nature before Nature had shown
what she really could do. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect to
sleep a wink as it is. I am perfectly sure the
beds will be damp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am sure they will not be. Douglas is
seeing about it now and she says they have
plenty of dry bed linen. You had better have
some coffee and I will dance with you until you
get sleepy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egad, that would be very pleasant! I am
going back to the city tomorrow and I could
sleep on the train, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t go tomorrow. I thought
you would be here over Sunday and we might
get up a little crowd and go sit on the rocks and
read aloud or something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if it clears I may change my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It has already cleared! Goody! Goody!
Now you will have to stay. Wouldn&rsquo;t the old-fashioned
waltz go well with that record Helen
has just put on? Do you know I adore the old-fashioned
waltz?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the old-fashioned waltz was the only thing
that staid bachelor could dance, never having
been able to master the new dances, this put
him in rare good humor. He swallowed his
coffee hastily, pronouncing it excellent, and in
a twinkling he and Dee were dancing the dances
of the early eighties and one more week-ender
was saved to the Carters to give the camp a
good name.</p>

<p>After a severe storm sometimes it is more of
a wonder what the damage isn&rsquo;t than what it is.
It seems at the time that nothing will ever be dry
and straight again, and then in a very short
while the world looks normal once more.</p>

<p>Camp Carter recuperated in a miraculous
manner. Only one tent had been blown away
and those that stood the test of wind had also
stood the test of rain. Some of the blankets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
were damp but most of them, thanks to Lewis&rsquo;
foresight, had been protected. The drainage on
the side of a mountain is naturally perfect so
there were no disconcerting puddles, and the
rocky paths were hardly muddy, so hard and
driving had been the downpour.</p>

<p>Lewis and Bill Tinsley went with Douglas
and Nan to take stock of the damage and to repair
what they could. Their relief was great
at the state of affairs until they entered the
cabin. The wind and rain had gone straight
through it. The pretty rag rugs were sopping
wet and, as I have said before, all the dainty
finery spread out on the bed, was blown hither
and yon. Douglas looked at the havoc in dismay.
Would her mother want to buy more
things to replace these that were ruined? She
missed the pretty hat intended for her own fair
head and was in a measure relieved that she
would not have to wear it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s build a fire immediately,&rdquo; and Nan
began to pile up paper and chips in the open
fireplace, the cabin boasting the one chimney in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
camp where a fire was possible. &ldquo;Now this will
dry out the room before mother comes in to go
to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and we had better put a cot in here for
Bobby, now that our tent is blown off,&rdquo; suggested
Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where will you and Bill sleep?&rdquo; asked
Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we can curl up on the floor of the pavilion.
Our cots are soaking. I kept the blankets
dry, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am so afraid you won&rsquo;t be comfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right! Get us in training for
the border! Bill and I have been living so soft
I fancy a little roughing it will be good for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lewis sounded rather bitter and Douglas felt
that she would give worlds if she could tell him
that she had decided she did care for him as he
wanted her to. Other girls pretended, why not
she? But there was an uprightness about
Douglas Carter that would not let her be a
party to any form of deceit. She was sorry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
very sorry, but she could not be like Tillie
Wingo and engage herself to anyone on a moment&rsquo;s
notice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are going to miss both of you ever and
ever so much. Think what it would be in a
time like this without you to help! I can hardly
contemplate running the camp without you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that will be easy enough! Skeeter and
Frank can do what we have done. You won&rsquo;t
miss us at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean just the work you do,&rdquo; faltered
poor Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, the rest won&rsquo;t amount to much,&rdquo;
declared Lewis, determined to be difficult.</p>

<p>Bill listened to his chum in amazement. He
was in such a seventh heaven of bliss himself
that he could not understand anyone&rsquo;s being anything
but happy. For his part he could not see
why Lewis didn&rsquo;t settle matters with his cousin
before going to the border. It never entered his
head that anyone could refuse a Greek god of a
fellow like Lewis Somerville. If a belle like
Tillie Wingo could put up with him, why, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
was not a girl living who would not jump at his
friend.</p>

<p>Nan sniffed a romance in the air where she
had not expected to find it. She, like all her family,
was so accustomed to the friendship between
her elder sister and Lewis that she had not
thought of a more serious relationship being the
outcome. Lewis was certainly sounding cold and
formal and Douglas was looking distressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see how it is,&rdquo; she said to herself; &ldquo;Lewis
has proposed to Douglas and Douglas has turned
him down. He told her he was going to enlist
and proposed all in one breath and poor old Doug
couldn&rsquo;t adjust herself fast enough. She no
doubt does love him but doesn&rsquo;t know it. Just
wait until he gets out of sight!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The week-enders were finally all put to bed in
dry sheets and warmed blankets, after having
drunk hot coffee and eaten a rarebit that was so
tender even the grouchiest of the grouchy could
not get up indigestion over it. The leaven of
good-humor spread by the Tuckers and Page Allison
had begun to work and all were rising to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the occasion and quite proud of themselves over
taking everything so philosophically.</p>

<p>The maiden lady who had threatened to leave
on the morning train but had been persuaded by
Zebedee to stay over to take a moonlight walk
with him was now loud in her praise of camp
life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say the only way to get along is to take
things as they come. I was just telling Mr.
Tucker that one can&rsquo;t expect the comforts of the
Jefferson Hotel up in camp, but then if one wants
the comforts of the Jefferson one had better go
there and not come to the country. Now I would
give up any comforts for the beauties of nature!&rdquo;
and so on, and so on!</p>

<p>Dee danced the old-fashioned waltz until she
almost forgot how to do a single modern step.
The grouchy bachelor forgot to worry about the
possibility of damp sheets and babbled along
about the dances of the eighties, and promised to
teach his young partner the racket and the heel
and toe polka if any of the records would fit
those defunct dances.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>The sprightliness of that particular bachelor
was catching, and the two others, who had begun
to inquire about time tables with a view to beating
a hasty retreat to the safety-firstness of the
city, found themselves cheering up, too; and
warmed by the good hot coffee, they began to
dance with youthful ardor and actually grumbled
when the crowd broke up for needed repose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t the Tuckers splendid?&rdquo; said Douglas,
when she and her sisters were undressing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed they are,&rdquo; agreed Helen, &ldquo;and I like
that little Allison girl a lot, too. She waltzed in
and helped with the eats as though she were one
of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Mr. Tucker is kind of gone on her,&rdquo;
drawled Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! You are always thinking somebody
is gone on somebody,&rdquo; laughed Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, somebody always is. He treats her
just like he does the twins, only different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that, like triplets?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Nan had gone to sleep before she could
formulate her ideas about how Mr. Tucker treated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Page. She only devoutly hoped he would devise
some method by which he could persuade
her mother to give up the idea of going to White
Sulphur and let Douglas alone about making her
debut the following winter.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="f8">MR. MACHIAVELLI TUCKER</span></h2>


<p>Nan wondered what Mr. Tucker had in mind
to relieve the situation which she had so ingenuously
disclosed to him on that little walk in the
moonlight. The next morning she watched him
closely and there was something about the businesslike
way in which he sought out Mrs. Carter,
when that lady appeared long after breakfast,
that made her divine he had something up his
sleeve.</p>

<p>The charming lady was looking especially
lovely in a white linen morning dress. She said
she had slept splendidly in spite of the fact that
she rather missed the rolling of the ship. Again
she had kept Susan so busy waiting on her that
the labor of serving breakfast properly had fallen
on Helen. A tray of breakfast had to be arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
exactly as though they were still in the
city, and Susan made many trips from the cabin
to the kitchen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter was one of those persons who was
always treated as more or less of an invalid because
of a certain delicate look she had, but her
girls could not remember her having had a real
illness. She must not be awakened in the morning
and she must never be asked to go out in bad
weather. She must have the daintiest food; the
warmest corner in winter and the coolest in summer.
She had never demanded these things, but
they had always been given her as though she
had a kind of divine right to them. Her husband
had, from the moment he saw her, the belle
of belles at White Sulphur, felt that she was to
be served as a little queen and the children had
slipped into their father&rsquo;s way.</p>

<p>No one would have been more astonished than
Annette Carter had anyone accused her of selfishness.
Selfishness was something ugly and
greedy and no one could say that she was that.
She never made demands on anyone. In fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
she quite prided herself on not making demands.
Everyone was kind and thoughtful of her, but
then was she not kind and thoughtful of everyone?
Had she not brought a present to every
one of her girls and a great box of expensive
toys for Bobby? It was not her fault that Bobby
preferred currying that disgraceful-looking old
mule to playing with the fine things she had purchased
for him at the most exclusive toy shop in
New York. Had she not even remembered
every one of the servants, not only Susan and
Oscar but the ones who had been in her service
when she had left Richmond? The fact that she
had charged all of these gifts and that the money
to pay for them was to be worked for by her
daughters had not for a moment entered her
mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how is camp life treating you this morning?&rdquo;
asked Jeffry Tucker, as he led the little
lady to a particularly pleasant corner of the pavilion
that commanded a view of the beautiful
apple orchards of that county of Virginia famous
for the Albemarle pippins. &ldquo;Did you ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
see such a morning? I can hardly believe that
only last night we were in the throes of the fiercest
storm I have ever seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am quite in love with camp life. It
is not so rough as I expected it to be when I
arrived yesterday. I have a very comfortable
bed and a nice bright fire cheered me up wonderfully
after I left the pavilion last night. I
must confess I was scared to death during the
storm, although I held on to myself wonderfully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, wonderfully!&rdquo; but Jeffry Tucker
crossed his fingers and reached out for a bit of
green from the pine tree growing close to the
post. He could not but picture the little woman
of the evening before hanging on to her husband,
intent on protecting her dress and shrieking
at every close flash of lightning or loud clap
of thunder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so glad you are here because I am
thinking of leaving my girls at the camp for
a while, and of course I could not think of doing
it unless you were here to chaperone them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I never thought of my presence being
necessary as a chaperone! You know I am
thinking of taking Douglas to the White for
a fortnight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am sorry. Of course I could not leave
my girls unless they are to be chaperoned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Robert will be here; he is enough
chaperone surely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, enough in our eyes but not the eyes of
the world. You see, I think one cannot be too
careful about what Mrs. Grundy will say,&rdquo; and
Jeffry Tucker crossed his fingers again and
reached for more green, &ldquo;especially when girls
are about the age of mine and yours, too, about
to be launched in the world, as it were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was devoutly thankful that his girls could
not hear him indulging in this homily. If there
ever lived a person who scorned Mrs. Grundy
that was this same Jeffry Tucker. He devoutly
hoped that Mrs. Carter would not hear
that Page Allison was in the habit of being
chaperoned by him, if one could call it being
chaperoned. He well knew that as a chaperone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Robert Carter had him beat a mile but he felt
that a little subterfuge was permissable in as
strenuous a case as this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Tucker, I did not dream you
were such a stickler for the proprieties!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahem&mdash;I am more so than I used to be.
Having these girls almost grown makes me
feel I must be more careful than&mdash;my nature&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;dictates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly! I respect you for it. I, too, think
it very important, especially if a girl is to make
a debut as I mean that Douglas shall. I am
very sorry, though, that you could not leave
Virginia and Caroline up here in Robert&rsquo;s care.
I am sure it will be all right for once. I have
quite set my heart on White Sulphur for a few
weeks. I think it gives a girl a certain poise
to be introduced to society in an informal way
before she makes her debut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am sorry, too, sorrier than I can
say. You see, I had planned to come up again
myself next Saturday and I thought I would
bring with me Hiram G. Parker. He would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
like this sort of thing and fit in nicely with these
young girls. You know how much he takes to
the girls before they are quite grown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;es!&rdquo; and Mrs. Carter was lost in a revery.</p>

<p>She well knew that the name of Hiram
G. Parker was one that controlled society. He
was the Beau Brummel of Richmond and in
some unaccountable way had become the dictator
of society, that is of the debutante society.
He passed the word about whether or
not a girl was to be a belle and his judgment
was seldom gainsaid. Mrs. Carter was thinking
that no doubt the presence of Hiram G.
Parker in their camp would be of more benefit
than a trip to White Sulphur. Her position in
society was of course assured beyond a doubt
but that did not mean a successful debut for
one of her daughters, certainly not for one who
was to be persuaded if not forced to be a debutante.
The business of coming out must be
taken quite seriously and the importance of it not
belittled. Poor Douglas was taking it seriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
enough, but not in a way her mother thought
desirable for success.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Mr. Tucker, I have half a
mind to give up the trip to White Sulphur.&mdash;It is
so pleasant here and so delightful to be with my
children again; and if your daughters and that
sweet little friend of theirs care to remain with
us, I shall be more than pleased to chaperone
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are kind!&rdquo; exclaimed the wily Zebedee.
&ldquo;I cannot thank you enough. If you
choose to make it so, Camp Carter will vie with
White Sulphur as a resort. I shall certainly
bring Parker up next week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Tucker grasped the first opportunity to
inform the anxious Nan of his successfully performed
mission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how did you do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By just a little twist of the wrist. You shall
have to put up with my girls though for another
week or so. Your mother has promised to
chaperone them until I fetch them away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Splendid! Do they want to stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They are dying to. I only hope they won&rsquo;t
tear things wide open at camp. They are terribly
hoydenish at times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Tucker, tell me: did you really get
mother to give up White Sulphur just to chaperone
the twins and Page?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ask her! I think she thinks she did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll call you Mr. Machiavelli
Tucker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t flatter me so yet. Wait until I accomplish
the seemingly impossible of making
your mother decide of her own accord that your
sister had better not come out yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you do that, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to sound conceited but I believe
I can. This is our secret, so don&rsquo;t tell a
soul that we have any hand in this matter. Just
let Douglas think it is fortune smiling on her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, but nothing can ever make me
forget your kindness!&rdquo; and Nan held his hand
with both of hers with no more trace of shyness
than Hiram G. Parker might have shown
in dancing a german.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth have you done to make Nan
so eternally grateful?&rdquo; demanded Dum Tucker,
coming suddenly around a spur of rock on the
mountain path where her father had accosted
Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to leave you girls up here for
some days longer. Isn&rsquo;t that enough for her to
be grateful over?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;ll, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;that sounds rather
fishy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And besides, I am going to send her up a
ouija board to pass the hours away until I return.
How about that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, now you are talking! That is something
to be grateful about. We are all of us dying to
try it,&rdquo; but Dum could not see why Nan was
blushing so furiously and evidently trying to
hold in the giggles, and she plainly caught a
wink passing between her dignified parent and
the demure Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s up to something, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be
very gentlemanly of me to try to find out if he
doesn&rsquo;t want me to know,&rdquo; she said to herself.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>The Tucker Twins had been motherless since
they were tiny babies and their ridiculously young
father had had the rearing of them alone and
unaided. Many stepmothers had been picked
out for these irrepressible girls by well meaning
friends and relatives, but Jeffry Tucker had
remained unmarried, much to the satisfaction of
the said twins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is much too young and inexperienced to
marry,&rdquo; they would say when the matter was
broached by wily mammas who hoped to settle
their daughters. And so he did seem to be.
Time had no power to age Jeffry Tucker. He
was in reality very young to be the father of
these great girls, as the romance of his life had
occurred when he was only twenty, still in college,
and the little wife had died after only a
year of happiness.</p>

<p>In rearing his girls he had had only one rule
to go by: they must conduct themselves like gentlemen
on all occasions. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
ladylike rules are but I do know what is expected
of a gentleman, and if my girls come up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
to that standard I am sure they will pass muster,&rdquo;
he had declared. As a rule the twins did
pass muster. They were perfectly honorable
and upright and the mischief they got into was
never anything to be ashamed of&mdash;only something
to be gotten out of, never too serious to
tell their father all about.</p>

<p>The fact that they were to stay longer than
the week-end was greeted with joy by the Carters.
Page had already made herself popular,
too. Douglas was soon informed by her mother
that she had given up the trip to the White, so
some of the load was lifted from the poor girl&rsquo;s
heart. There was much more talk, however, of
the proposed debut and Helen upheld her mother
in thinking that since Douglas was not going to
college she must come out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Helen, the money for a debut! And
if we go into our house and turn out the desirable
tenants, where are we to get an income
to exist on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, always money, money! It can be gotten,
and mother says our credit is as good as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
U.&nbsp;S. mint. She has often heard father say
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it was as good, but now that
father is no longer able to earn money it would
not be quite square to presume on that credit
when we have no way of paying the bills.&rdquo; Douglas
would go over and over the same argument
and Helen would still not be convinced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we to spend the rest of our lives digging
and delving for gold and then not use the
money? How does our bank account stand
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but it is not so large that we
could make a debut on it,&rdquo; smiled Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we could make a start and then earn
some more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why spend it on me when I don&rsquo;t want
to go into society?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, for mother&rsquo;s sake, goose. She has
set her heart on it and you know we have always
let her do whatever she wanted to. It
would make father miserable to think mother
wanted something and could not have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know! He mustn&rsquo;t know she wants it
and can&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she must have it. She is planning all
the time for your being a great belle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Wright said that father&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but Helen
flounced off, refusing to hear what Dr. Wright
said. She had overcome all of her antipathy
for that young physician and in fact liked him
rather more than anyone of her acquaintance of
the male persuasion, but she still resented any
tendency on his part to dictate to her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter, having given up her trip to
White Sulphur, felt that virtue must be rewarded
and so actually persuaded Douglas to
protect her complexion. She was not allowed
to go in the sun at all and in the shade she
must wear a great hat tied under her chin, with a
curtain of blue veiling draped over it. Every
night she must be anointed with some kind of
cucumber cream and her hair must be brushed
with one hundred licks every night and morning.</p>

<p>Lewis Somerville and Bill Tinsley made their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
sorrowful adieux. Everyone missed them. They
seemed as important to the camp as the great
poplar tree in the center of the pavilion was to
that edifice. There was a feeling that everything
might topple over now that those two
young men were gone. It didn&rsquo;t, however.
Skeeter Halsey and Frank Maury did what they
could to fill their places, but as they expressed
it, they &ldquo;sho&rsquo; did rattle &rsquo;round in &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Carter, too, delighted to be of use and to
find something he could do without using his
poor fagged brain too much, was busy at something
from morning until night. First the reservoir
must be repaired after the heavy rain had
caved in part of the dam; then the roof of the
cabin needed a shingle here and there. A rustic
bench must be put by the spring which
formed the reservoir, and then a table was
added so that afternoon tea might be served
there on occasions. He was so busy and so
happy in being busy that it was delightful to
see him. Bobby was his companion at all times,
even deserting the beloved Josh and Josephus to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
be with his father. This was a new father, one
who had time to play and talk. Together they
made wonderful little water wheels and put
them in a tiny mountain stream where they
turned continuously to the delight of Bobby.
The successful architect of other days drew
plans for bird houses and he and his little son
whittled them out of stray bits of lumber and
cigar boxes and placed them in the trees, no
doubt filling a long felt want for suburban
villas in bird society.</p>

<p>The miracle was happening! The cure that
Dr. Wright had predicted was taking place.
Robert Carter was on the high road to recovery.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="f8">MR. HIRAM G. PARKER</span></h2>


<p>Susan had been kept very busy all week doing
lady&rsquo;s maid work for her mistress. Susan&rsquo;s
usefulness in the kitchen was about over, the
Carter girls feared. There never seemed to
be a moment that she was not wanted to wait
on Mrs. Carter. When she took the daintily arranged
breakfast tray to the cabin she was kept
to fetch and carry and do a million foolish
little nothings that an idle woman can always
find to occupy other persons. Then the many
new dresses must be pressed and white skirts
must be laundered. Mrs. Carter always had
worn white in the summer, and although washing
was something of a problem at the camp, she
still must wear white. Not a speck must be on
those snowy garments even if it did take all of
Susan&rsquo;s time to keep them in condition.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no excuse for letting oneself go even
if it is necessary to live in a camp,&rdquo; she would
assert. &ldquo;I think it is very important to look
nice wherever one happens to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sho&rsquo; is, Mis&rsquo; Carter, an&rsquo; you jes&rsquo; call on
me to washanirn all the things you need. That&rsquo;s
what I&rsquo;m here fur,&rdquo; and Susan, who much preferred
the job of lady&rsquo;s maid to that of assistant
cook, gathered up an armful of rumpled
skirts and blouses and carried them off to
launder. She adored her mistress and saw no
reason at all why the girls need mind doing
extra work so that she could give all of her
attention to the whims of the mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all that?&rdquo; grumbled Oscar, who saw
many reasons why Miss Helen should not be
doing Susan&rsquo;s work. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to do
no washinanirnin&rsquo; in this hyar kitchen today.
You know puffectly well that them thar week-enders
is a-comin&rsquo; pilin&rsquo; in hyar this ebenin&rsquo;,
all of &rsquo;em as empty as gourds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, these here langery is got to be did up,
an&rsquo; I is got to do &rsquo;em up, an&rsquo; as fur as I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
thain&rsquo;t no place to do &rsquo;em up but in the kitchen.
It&rsquo;s jes&rsquo; because of some of these here week-enders
that they is got to be landered. You is
so ign&rsquo;rant that you don&rsquo;t know that one of
these here week-enders what is a-comin&rsquo; is what
Mis&rsquo; Carter call a arbitrator of sassiety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I may be ign&rsquo;rant but I knows one
thing, that ifn a nice little gal named Miss Page
Allison hadn&rsquo;t a come in an&rsquo; helped Miss Helen
an&rsquo; I, we wouldn&rsquo;t a got breakfast on the table.
Miss Gwen warn&rsquo;t here this mornin&rsquo; cause that
ole po&rsquo; white mounting ooman what she calls Aunt
Mandy done took with cramps in the night an&rsquo;
Miss Gwen couldn&rsquo;t leave her. This is a been
the busiest week of the camp an&rsquo; you&mdash;you
ain&rsquo;t been wuth standin&rsquo; room in de bad place
all week. You an&rsquo; yo&rsquo; mistress with yo&rsquo; langery
an&rsquo; yo&rsquo; arbors of sassiety. I don&rsquo;t know
who he is a-comin&rsquo; but whoever he is, he ain&rsquo;t
no better&rsquo;n our folks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s Mr. Hiram G. Parker hisself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, that little ole Hi Parker? He ain&rsquo;t
nuthin&rsquo;. If he&rsquo;s done riz to the top er sassiety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
it&rsquo;s caze he&rsquo;s the scum an&rsquo; the scum jes natch&rsquo;ly
gits on top. Who was his folks? Tell me that,
who was they? You don&rsquo;t know an&rsquo; neither do
lots er folks but I knows an&rsquo; he knows. That&rsquo;s
the reason he&rsquo;s so partic&rsquo;lar &rsquo;bout who he consorts
with. He has to be! Yi! Yi! He has
to be! Arbor er sassiety much! Back po&rsquo;ch er
sassiety, mo&rsquo; lak!&rdquo; and Oscar chuckled with delight
at his wit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I betcher Mis&rsquo; Carter better not hear you a-talkin&rsquo;
thataway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; ter hear me&mdash;&rsquo;cause
I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; ter talk thataway befo&rsquo; her, but
that ain&rsquo;t a-keepin&rsquo; me from knowin&rsquo; all about
little Hi Parker&rsquo;s fo-bars. Thain&rsquo;t much ter
know &rsquo;cause he warn&rsquo;t troubled with many. His
grandpap had a waggin with a bell on it an&rsquo;
went aroun&rsquo; hollerin: &lsquo;Ragsoleioncopperanbrass!
Ragsoleioncopperanbrass!&rsquo; I &rsquo;member
it mighty well &rsquo;cause my mammy uster say she
goin&rsquo; ter thow me in the waggin an&rsquo; sell me ter
ole Parker if I didn&rsquo;t &rsquo;have myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, howsomever it might a-been, tain&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
thataway now! Mis&rsquo; Carter is &rsquo;cited over his
a-comin&rsquo;. She done made po&rsquo; Miss Douglas
sleep with some kinder wax on her competence
las&rsquo; night to peel off the remains of the sunburn
an&rsquo; she done made her promus not to wear
that there cowboy suit for supper. Mis&rsquo; Carter
says she thinks Miss Douglas oughter be dressed
in diafricanus interial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! The missus is all right, but she
better let these here young ladies run this here
camp like they been doin&rsquo;. If they take to dressin&rsquo;
up it&rsquo;ll mean all yo&rsquo; time&rsquo;ll be spent pressin&rsquo;
an&rsquo; fixin&rsquo; an&rsquo; I want ter know who&rsquo;ll be a-doin&rsquo;
yo&rsquo; work. Not me! By the time I get through
butlerin&rsquo; these here week-enders, I ain&rsquo;t got the
back ter washanwipe all the dishes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Susan quietly started the charcoal brazier and
put her irons to heat. She knew that the mistress&rsquo;
word was law and that although Oscar
might grumble until he was even blacker in the
face than nature had made him, he would go on
washing dishes until he dropped in his tracks
rather than make a real disturbance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Nan and Dum Tucker came to the kitchen
after breakfast and helped him while Susan
washed and ironed the many white things that
Mrs. Carter had discarded as too soiled to appear
before Mr. Hiram G. Parker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wash and you wipe,&rdquo; suggested Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, please let me wash,&rdquo; begged Dum, &ldquo;I
adore sloshing in suds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;s lots er suds here ter slosh in,&rdquo;
grinned Oscar, bringing a great steaming dish
pan, &ldquo;an&rsquo; if you is so enjoyful of suds, mebbe
you young ladies could spare me altogether an&rsquo;
let me pick them there chickens &rsquo;gainst it&rsquo;s time
ter fry &rsquo;em for supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed! Go!&rdquo; from Dum. &ldquo;We can
do them in no time, can&rsquo;t we, Nan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can do them, but not in no time,&rdquo;
drawled Nan. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think it is right for
people to use so many dishes. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be
grand to be like Aeneas and put your food on
a little cake and then eat the cake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but if you can&rsquo;t do that, I think the
feeders should at least have the grace to lick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
their plates. What on earth do you do with
all the scraps?&rdquo; asked Dum as she vigorously
scraped plates, a part of the work that everyone
hates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fatten chickens for killin&rsquo;,&rdquo; answered Oscar,
sharpening a great knife fit for the deed he had
to do. &ldquo;For land&rsquo;s sake, Miss Dum, don&rsquo;t arsk
none of the week-enders ter lick they plates.
They don&rsquo;t leave nothin&rsquo; now for my chickens.
The gals even eat the tater peelin&rsquo;s. They say
it gwine make they har curl, but they eat so
much they don&rsquo;t leave no room for they har ter
curl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dum and Nan had become fast friends during
that week at camp. The several years&rsquo; difference
in their ages was as nothing. The feeling
for beauty which both of them had to a
great degree was what drew them together.
Nan was so quiet and unostentatious in her unselfishness,
few at the camp realized how much
she did. For instance: the person who cooks
a meal is usually praised by the hungry ones,
but the person who patiently scrapes and washes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
dishes is hardly thought of at all by the satiated.
On that Friday morning, Helen had,
with the help of Page, produced a wonderful
breakfast; and when these two girls came to
that meal flushed but triumphant in the knowledge
that their popovers popped over and that
their omelettes had risen to the occasion, the
breakfasters had given them three rousing
cheers. No one thought of who was going to
wash up.</p>

<p>While Dum was sloshing in the suds and Nan
was busily drying the dishes that piled up to such
great heights they looked like ramparts, Page
and Helen came in to try their hands at pies
for Saturday&rsquo;s picnic. Page had on one of
Helen&rsquo;s bungalow aprons and seemed as much
at home as though she had been born and bred
in camp. Page always had that quality of making
herself at home wherever she happened to
drop. Dee used to say she was just like a kitten
and wasn&rsquo;t particular where she was, just
so it was pleasant and people were kind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of pies shall it be?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Something not too squashy!&rdquo; pleaded Dum.
&ldquo;Nan and I have found the most adorable spot
for a picnic: a fallen tree about half a mile
around the mountain&mdash;not a freshly fallen one
but one that must have fallen ages and ages ago
as it has decided just to grow horizontally.
Any old person could climb up it, just walk up
it in fact&mdash;such seats were never imagined&mdash;the
limbs all twisted into armchairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course if we are going to eat up a tree
we had better have mighty solid pies,&rdquo; laughed
Page. &ldquo;How about fried turnovers like Mammy
Susan makes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grand!&rdquo; from Dum. &ldquo;Apple?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, apple,&rdquo; laughed Helen, amused at Dum&rsquo;s
enthusiasm, &ldquo;also some lemon pies, don&rsquo;t you
think? I mean cheese cakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Splendid and more and more splendid!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls went to work, Page on the fried
turnovers and Helen on the cheese cakes. Such
a merry time they were having, all busy and all
talking! Oscar sat outside picking chickens and
of necessity Susan was driven to the extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
corner of the kitchen with her heap of washing
and ironing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are awfully clever, Helen, to
learn to make pastry so quickly. How did you
do it?&rdquo; said Page, deftly forming a turnover.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I just did it. It seems to me
as though anyone can cook who will follow a
recipe. I had a few lessons at the Y.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A.
in the spring and I learned a lot there. How did
you learn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, when I was a kiddie I had no one to
play with but Mammy Susan, so I used to stay
in the kitchen and play cooking. I&rsquo;ve been making
thimble biscuit and eggshell cake ever since
I could walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you make eggshell cake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just put the left-over scrapings of batter
in the eggshells and bake it. It cooks in a minute
and then you peel off the shell. Scrumptious!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dee came running in with the mail, having
been to the post office at Greendale with Josh
and Bobby and the faithful Josephus.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A letter from Zebedee and he will be up for
sure this evening! Ain&rsquo;t that grand? But guess
who is coming with him&mdash;old Hiram G. Parker!
I believe Zebedee must have lost his mind. I
am really uneasy about him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what is the matter with Mr. Parker?&rdquo;
asked Helen, who had been much interested in
what she had heard of that gentleman&rsquo;s charms
and graces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No matter, no matter, only ideas!&rsquo; as the
idealist said when the materialist saw him falling
down stairs, bumping his head at every step,
and asked him what was the matter,&rdquo; laughed
Dee. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you ever meet Mr. Parker?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I have always understood he was
all kinds of lovely things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; put in Dum, &ldquo;if you like wax
works. He wears the prettiest pants in town
and has more neckties and socks than an ordinary
man could buy if he went shopping every
day. He knows all the latest jokes and when
they give out, he starts in on the others. He
makes jokes of his own, too&mdash;not like Zebedee&rsquo;s&mdash;Zebedee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
always bubbles out in a joke but
Hiram G. leads up to his. First he gets one, a
joke I mean, and then he gets a crowd of listeners.
Then he directs the conversation into
the proper channel and dams it up and when it
is just right he launches his joke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You certainly do mix your metaphors,&rdquo;
laughed Page, crimping her turnovers with a
fork. &ldquo;You start out with bubbling brooks and
end up with the launching of ships.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;She starts! she moves! she seems to feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thrill of life along her keel.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Zebedee does bubble and Hiram G.
Parker doesn&rsquo;t; neither does a boat, so there.
Oh, oh! Look at the goodies. How on earth
do you make such cute edges to your tarts?
Just see them, girls!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did mine with a broken fork but Mammy
Susan says she knows an old woman who always
did hers with her false teeth.&rdquo; After the shout
that went up from this had subsided, Helen
begged to know more of Mr. Parker.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he a great friend of your father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why no, that is the reason I can&rsquo;t divine
why he is bringing him up here. I believe Zebedee
likes him well enough&mdash;at least I never
heard him say anything to the contrary. There
is no harm in the dude that I ever heard of.
Of course he is the Lord High Muck-a-Muck
with the buds. He decides which ones are to
ornament society and which ones to be picked
for funerals. He has already looked over Dum
and me at a hop last Thanksgiving at the Jefferson;
Page, too. I believe he thinks we&rsquo;ll do,
at least he danced us around and wrote on our
back with invisible chalk: &lsquo;Passed by the Censor
of Society.&rsquo; I believe he thinks a lot of
Zebedee, but then everyone does who has even
a glimmering of sense,&rdquo; and Dee reread her
father&rsquo;s letter, a joint one for her and her sister,
with a postscript for Page.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all he says is that he is coming and
going to bring the immaculate Hi and we must
behave,&rdquo; declared Dum, reading over Dee&rsquo;s
shoulder. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I am going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
behave or not. That Mr. Parker gets on my
nerves. He&rsquo;s too clean, somehow. I&rsquo;m mighty
afraid I&rsquo;m going to roll him down the mountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mis&rsquo; Carter is fixin&rsquo; up a lot for the gent,&rdquo;
said Susan, who had been busily engaged with
her wash tub while the girls were talking, &ldquo;if
it&rsquo;s Mr. Hiram G. Parker you is a-speakin&rsquo; of.
She done say he is a very high-up pusson. I
do believe it was all on account of him that she
done made Miss Douglas look after her hide so
keerful this week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, does mother know he is coming up?&rdquo;
asked Helen. &ldquo;She never told me. Nan, did
you know he was coming?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan hadn&rsquo;t known, but she had a great light
break on her mind when she heard that her
mother knew he was to come: Mr. Tucker had
certainly used this visit of Mr. Parker&rsquo;s to persuade
her mother to give up the trip to White
Sulphur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! I never heard a word of it,&rdquo; Nan answered
sedately but her eyes were dancing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
it was with difficulty that she restrained a giggle.</p>

<p>How could her mother be so easily influenced?
She must consider Mr. Parker very well worth
while to stay at camp just to see him. That was
the reason for all of this extra washing and
ironing Susan had on hand. Nan loved her
mother devotedly but she had begun to feel that
perhaps she was a very&mdash;well, to say the least&mdash;a
very frivolous lady. Nan&rsquo;s judgment was in
a measure more mature than Helen&rsquo;s although
Helen was almost two years her senior. Where
Helen loved, she loved without any thought of
the loved one&rsquo;s having any fault. She wondered
now that her mother should have known of
Mr. Parker&rsquo;s coming without mentioning it, but
as for that little lady&rsquo;s dressing up to see this
society man, why, that was just as it should
be. She had absolutely no inkling of her mother&rsquo;s
maneuvering to push Douglas toward a
successful debut. Susan&rsquo;s intimation that Douglas
was to preserve her complexion for Mr.
Parker&rsquo;s benefit was simply nonsense. Susan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
was after all a very foolish colored girl who
had gotten things mixed. Douglas was to protect
her delicate blond skin for all society, not
for any particular member of it.</p>

<p>The train arrived bearing many week-enders
and among them Zebedee and the precious Mr.
Hiram G. Parker, looking his very fittest in a
pearl gray suit with mauve tie and socks and a
Panama hat that had but recently left the block.
Zebedee could not help smiling at the fine wardrobe
trunk that his companion had brought and
comparing it with his own small grip with its
changes of linen packed in the bottom and the
boxes of candy for Tweedles and Page squeezed
on top.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven, I don&rsquo;t have a reputation
to keep up!&rdquo; he said to himself.</p>

<p>The wardrobe trunk was not very large, not
much more bulky than a suitcase but it had to
be carried up the mountain by Josephus and its
owner seemed to be very solicitous that it should
be stood on the proper end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One&rsquo;s things get in an awful mess from these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
mountain roads. A wardrobe trunk should be
kept upright, otherwise even the most skillful
packing cannot insure one that trousers will not
be mussed and coats literally ruined.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Tucker felt like laughing outright but
he had an ax to grind and Hiram G. Parker
was to turn the wheel, so he bridled his inclination.
He had asked the society man to be his
guest for the week-end, intimating that he had
a favor to ask of him. Parker accepted, as he
had an idea he would, since the summer was
none too full of invitations with almost no one
in town. His position in the bank held him in
town and he must also hold the position, since
it was through it he was enabled to belong to all
the clubs and to have pressed suits for all occasions.
He had no idea what the favor was
but he liked to keep in with these newspaper
chaps since it was through the newspapers, when
all was told, that he had attained his success,
and through the society columns of those dailies
that he kept in the public eye. He liked Jeffry
Tucker, too, for himself. There was something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
so spontaneous about him. With all of Hiram
Parker&rsquo;s society veneer there was a human being
somewhere down under the varnish and a heart,
not very big, but good of its kind.</p>

<p>On the train en route to Greendale Mr. Tucker
had divulged what that favor was. He led up
to it adroitly so that when he finally reached
it Mr. Parker was hardly aware of the fact that
he had arrived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long list of debutantes this season, I hear,&rdquo;
he started out with, handing an excellent cigar
to his guest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, something appalling!&rdquo; answered Mr.
Parker, settling himself comfortably in the
smoker after having taken off his coat and produced
a pocket hanger to keep that garment
in all the glory of a recent pressing. &ldquo;I see
many hen parties in prospect. There won&rsquo;t be
near enough beaux to go round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I hear, especially since the militia has
been ordered to the border. So many dancing
men are in the Blues. I heard today that young
Lane is off. He is Robert Carter&rsquo;s assistant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and since Carter has been out of the running
has been endeavoring to keep the business going.
I fancy it will be a blow to the Carters
that he has had to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, too bad! Quite a dancing man! He
will be missed in the germans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jeffry Tucker smiled as he had been thinking
the Carters might miss the assistance that Lane
rendered their father, but since Mr. Parker&rsquo;s
mind ran more on germans than on business that
was, after all, what he was bringing him up to
Greendale for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lewis Somerville has enlisted, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say! I had an idea when he left
West Point he would be quite an addition to
Richmond society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Mrs. Carter thought he would be
of great assistance to her eldest daughter,&rdquo; said
Mr. Machiavelli Tucker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hadn&rsquo;t heard that one of Robert Carter&rsquo;s
daughters was to make her debut. I haven&rsquo;t
seen her name on the list. Is she a good
looker?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Lovely and very sweet! I think it is a pity
for her to come out and not be a success, but
her mother is determined that she shall enter
the ring this winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is a pity. This will be a bad year for
buds. There are already so many of them and
such a dearth of beaux I have never beheld. I
don&rsquo;t care how good-looking a girl is, she is going
to have a hard time having a good time this
year,&rdquo; and the expert sighed, thinking of the
work ahead of him in entertaining debutantes.
He was not so young as he had been and there
were evenings when he rather longed to get into
slippers and dressing gown and let himself go,
but a leader must be on the job constantly or
someone else would usurp his place. Many debutantes
and a few society men meant he must redouble
his activities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you will be nice to this girl, Hi. She
is a splendid creature. Since her father has
been sick, she has taken the burden of the
whole family on her shoulders. All of the girls
help and the second one, Helen, is doing wonders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
too&mdash;in fact, all of them are wonders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; thought the leader of germans, &ldquo;we
are coming to the favor. Tucker wants me to
help launch this girl. Well, I&rsquo;ll look her over
first. No pig in a poke for me!&rdquo; He took another
of the very good cigars, not that he wanted
it at that moment, but he might need it later on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now this is what I want you to do, this is
how I want you to be good to her.&rdquo; Hi Parker
smiled a knowing smile. How many times had
he been approached in just this way? &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want you to ask her to dance a german with
you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh, what was the fellow driving at, anyhow?</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed! There is no man living that I
would ask to do such a thing. I feel it is a kind
of insult to a girl to go around drumming up
partners for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Parker gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I want you to do for me is to persuade
Mrs. Carter that this is a bad year to bring a
girl out. You have already said you think it is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
so you would be perfectly honest in doing so.
The Carters&rsquo; finances are at a low ebb and this
fine girl, Douglas, is doing her best to economize
and have the family realize the importance of it,
and now her mother is determined that she shall
stop everything and go into society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Tucker, during the journey to Greendale,
succeeded in convincing Mr. Parker that
it was an easy matter to persuade Mrs. Carter
to give up the project.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do what I can, but if you take the matter
so much to heart why don&rsquo;t you do it yourself,
Tucker? I make it a rule not to butt in
on society&rsquo;s private affairs if I can possibly
keep out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ask you because I believe in getting an expert
when a delicate operation is needed. You
are a social expert and this is a serious matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The upshot was that Mr. Hiram G. Parker
was flattered into making the attempt and
Mrs. Carter&rsquo;s opinion of that gentleman&rsquo;s social
knowledge was so great and her faith in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
him so deep-rooted that she abandoned her idea
of forcing Douglas out for that season. She
gave it up with a sigh of resignation. Anyhow,
she was glad she had made Douglas bleach her
complexion before Mr. Parker was introduced
to her. The girl was looking lovely and the
shyness she evinced on meeting that great man
was just as it should be. Too much assurance
was out of place with a bud and this introduction
and impression would hold over until another
year.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="f8">THE BIRD</span></h2>


<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Softly a winged thing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Floats across the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And earth from slumber waketh<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>Late sleeping in a tent is rather a difficult feat
as the morning sun seems to spy out the sleeper&rsquo;s
eyes and there is no way to escape him.
Some of the campers tied black ribbons around
their eyes and some even used black stockings,
but the first rays of the sun always found Nan
stirring. It was not that she was especially energetic,
she was indeed rather lazy, according
to her more vigorous sisters, but the charm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the early morning was so wonderful that she
hated to miss it lying in bed. It was also such
a splendid time to be alone. The camp was a
bustling, noisy place when everyone was up,
and early morning was about the only time the
girl had for that communing with herself which
was very precious to one of her poetic temperament.</p>

<p>She slept in a tent, not only with her sisters
but with Lil Tate and Tillie Wingo, now that
the week-enders had swarmed in on them at
such a rate, stretching their sleeping accommodations
to the utmost. Of course it was great
fun to sleep in a tent but there were times when
Nan longed for a room with four walls and a
door that she could lock. The next best thing
to a door she could lock was the top of the
mountain in the early morning. Unless some
enthusiastic nature-lover had got up a sunrise
party she was sure to have the top of the mountain
to herself.</p>

<p>Mr. Tucker had divulged to her the night
before that her mother had abandoned the designs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
she had been entertaining for Douglas,
and she in turn had been able to pass on the good
news to Douglas. Mrs. Carter had not told her
daughter herself but was evidently going to
take her own good time to do so. Their mother&rsquo;s
being a bit cattish was not worrying either
Douglas or Nan. They were too happy over
the abandonment of the plan. Of course they
could not help feeling that since the plan was
abandoned, it would have been sweet of their
mother to let Douglas know immediately since
she was well aware of the fact that the idea
was far from pleasing to her daughter. And
since it would have been sweet of her to let her
know the moment she had abandoned the plan,
it was on the other hand slightly cattish of her
to conceal the fact. Of course the girls did
not call it cattish even in their own minds&mdash;just
thoughtlessness. Douglas had no idea
of how the change had come about, and Nan
held her counsel. It was Mr. Tucker&rsquo;s and her
secret.</p>

<p>As she crept out of the cot on that morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
before the sun was up, she glanced at her elder
sister and a feeling of intense satisfaction filled
her heart to see how peacefully Douglas was
sleeping. Her beautiful hair, in a great golden
red rope, was trailing from the low cot along
the floor of the tent; her face that had looked
so tired and anxious lately had lost its worried
expression&mdash;she looked so young&mdash;hardly any
older than Lucy, who lay in the next bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness, the poor dear is no longer
worried,&rdquo; thought Nan devoutly as she slipped
on her clothes and crept noiselessly out of the
tent.</p>

<p>What a morning it was! The sun was not
quite up and there was a silver gray haze over
everything. The neighboring mountains were
lost, as were the valleys. The air had a freshness
and sweetness that is peculiar to dawn.
&ldquo;&lsquo;The innocent brightness of a new-born day
is lovely yet,&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted Nan. &ldquo;If I can only get
to the top of the mountain before the sun is
up!&rdquo; She hurried along the path, stopping a
moment at the spring to drink a deep draft of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
water and to splash the clear water on her face
and hands. She held her face down in the
water a moment and came up shaking the drops
off her black hair, which curled in innumerable
little rings from the wetting. She laughed
aloud in glee. Life was surely worth living,
everything was so beautiful.</p>

<p>The sides of the mountain were thickly
wooded but at the top there was a smooth
plateau with neither tree nor bush. One great
rock right in the middle of this clearing Nan
used as a throne whereon she could view the
world&mdash;if not the world, at least a good part
of Albemarle county and even into Nelson on
one hand and Orange on the other. Sometimes
she thought of this stone as an altar and of
herself as a sun-worshipper.</p>

<p>On that morning she clambered up the rock
just a moment before the sun peeped through
a crack in the mist. She stood with arms outstretched
facing the sun. The mists were rolling
away and down in the valley she could distinguish
the apple orchards and now a fence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and now a haystack. There a mountain cabin
emerged from the veil and soon a spiral of thin
blue smoke could be spied rising from its chimney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what they are going to have for
breakfast!&rdquo; exclaimed the wood nymph, and then
she took herself to task for thinking of food
when everything was so poetical. Just as she
was wondering what the mountaineers who lived
in that tiny cabin were going to cook on the
fire whose smoke she saw rising in that &ldquo;thin
blue reek&rdquo; the sun came up. A wonderful
sight, but the sun has been rising for so many
æons that we have become accustomed to it.
Something else happened at that moment, something
we are not quite accustomed to even yet:
Far off over the crest of a mountain Nan
thought she saw an eagle. The first rays of the
sun glinted on the great white wings. For a moment
it was lost to view as it passed behind a
cloud and then it appeared again flying rapidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is coming this way, a great white bird!
I am almost afraid it might pick me up in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
huge talons and carry me off, carry me &rsquo;way up
in the air&mdash;I almost hope it will&mdash;it would be
so glorious to fly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stood up on her throne and stretched her
arms out, crying an invocation to the winged
thing.</p>

<p>She heeded not the buzzing of the aeroplane
as it approached. To her it was a great white
bird and she only awakened from her trance
when the machine had actually landed on her
plateau.</p>

<p>The humming had stopped and it glided along
the grass, kept closely cropped by Josephus, as
this was his grazing ground when he was not
busy pulling the cart. Nan stood as though petrified,
a graceful little figure in her camp-fire
girls&rsquo; dress. Her arms were still outstretched
as when she cried her invocation to the great
white bird.</p>

<p>The machine came to a standstill quite close to
her altar and a young man in aviator&rsquo;s costume
sprang from it. Taking off his helmet and goggles,
he made a low bow to Nan.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mountain nymph, may a traveler land
in your domain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome, stranger!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And may I ask what is this enchanted land?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Helicon&mdash;and you&mdash;who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Bellerophon and yonder winged steed
is Pegasus. Maid, will you fly with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held out his hand and Nan, with no more
thought of the proprieties than a real mountain
nymph would have had, let him help her into
his machine. He wrapped a great coat around
her, remarking that even nymphs might get
cold, and seemingly with no more concern than
Bill Tinsley felt over starting the mountain
goat, he touched some buttons and turned some
wheels and in a moment the aeroplane was
gliding over the plateau and then floating in the
air, mounting slowly over the tree tops. Up, up
they went and then began making beautiful circles
in the air. Nan sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you scared?&rdquo; and the aviator looked
anxiously at his little companion. He had
not resumed his helmet and goggles and his eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
were so kind and so merry that Nan felt as
though she had known him all her life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scared! Of course not! I am just so
happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you ever flown before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in reality&mdash;but it is just as I have
dreamed it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dream then a great deal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! &lsquo;In a dream all day I wander only
half awake.&rsquo; I am sure I must be dreaming
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, too! But then the best of life is the
dreams, the greatest men are the dreamers. If
it had not been for a dreamer, we could not
have had this machine. Look! Isn&rsquo;t that wonderful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan was looking with all eyes at the panorama
spread out below them. The sun was up now in
good earnest and the mountains had shaken off
the mist as sleepers newly aroused might throw
off their coverlids. The orchards in the valleys
looked like cabbage beds and the great mansions
that adorn the hills and are the pride and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
boast of the county seemed no larger than doll
houses. From every chimney in the valley smoke
was arising. Nan was disgusted with herself
that again the thought came to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are all of these people going to have
for breakfast?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They dipped and floated and curvetted. Nan
thought of Hawthorne&rsquo;s description of Pegasus
in the &ldquo;Chimæra&rdquo; and the very first opportunity
she had later on she got the book and reread
the following passage:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how fine a thing it is to be a winged
horse! Sleeping at night, as he did, on a lofty
mountain-top, and passing the greater part of
the day in the air, Pegasus seemed hardly to
be a creature of the earth. Whenever he was
seen, up very high above people&rsquo;s heads, with
the sunshine on his silvery wings, you would
have thought that he belonged to the sky, and
that, skimming a little too low, he had got astray
among our mists and vapors, and was seeking
his way back again. It was very pretty to behold
him plunge into the fleecy bosom of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
bright cloud, and be lost in it for a moment or
two, and then break forth from the other side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once they went through a low-hanging cloud.
Nan felt the drops of water on her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it is raining!&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that was a cloud we dipped through,&rdquo;
laughed her companion. &ldquo;Are you cold?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cold? I don&rsquo;t know! I have no sensation
but joy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man smiled. There was something
about Nan&rsquo;s drawl that made persons
want to smile anyhow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forgot your hat and goggles,&rdquo; she said
as she noticed his blue eyes and the closely
cropped brown hair that looked as though it had
to be very closely cropped to keep it from curling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so! Some day maybe I shall go back
after them. Now shall we fly to &rsquo;Frisco? How
about High Olympus? Remember we are on
Pegasus now and he can take us wherever we
want to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Breakfast first,&rdquo; drawled Nan. &ldquo;Come with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
me and I can feed you on nectar and ambrosia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh what a wonderful wood nymph! She understands
that mortal man cannot feed on poetry
alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They glided to the plateau and landed again
by the great rock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a wonderful place to light,&rdquo; said the
birdman. &ldquo;And now, fair mountain nymph,
please tell me who you are when you are not a
nymph&mdash;and what you are doing on the top of
a lonely mountain before the sun is up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan Carter! And if you think this is a
lonely mountain, you ought to try to get by yourself
for a few minutes on it. Before sunrise,
on the tip top point, is the only place where one
can be alone a minute&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then great creatures come swooping
down out of the clouds and carry you off. It
was very kind of you to go with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kind of me! Oh, Mr. Bellerophon, I never
can thank you enough for taking me. I have
never been so happy in all my life. It is perfect,
all but the noise&mdash; I do wish it wouldn&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
click and buzz so. I know Pegasus did not
make such a fuss&mdash;only the swish of his wings
could be heard and sometimes, as the maiden
said, the brisk and melodious neigh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to know my name, too, Miss
Nan Carter? I have a name I use sometimes
when I am not mounted on Pegasus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know it at all, but perhaps
my mother, who is chaperoning the camp and
who is rather particular, might think Mr. Bellerophon
sounded rather wily Greekish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man laughed. Such a nice laugh
it was that Nan could not help thinking it
sounded rather like a melodious neigh. He was
possessed of very even white teeth and a Greek
profile, at least it started out to be Greek but
changed its mind when it got to the tip of his
nose which certainly turned up a bit. On the
whole he was a very pleasant, agreeable-looking
young man, tall and broad-shouldered, clean-limbed
and athletic-looking. What Nan liked
most about him were his eyes and his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate to tell you my name, wood nymph. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
sounds so commonplace after what we have done
this morning. I am afraid when you hear it
you will simply knock on one of these great oak
trees and a door will open and you will disappear
from my eyes forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not before breakfast,&rdquo; drawled Nan. &ldquo;But
you must tell me your name before breakfast
because I shall have to introduce you to the
others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What others? Not more wood nymphs!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More Carters&mdash;and week-enders!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean I have actually landed at
Week-End Camp? Why, that is what I have
been looking for, but I had no idea of striking it
the first thing, right out of the blue, as it were.
I heard about the camp at the University, and
want to come board there for a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am the one to apply to,&rdquo; said Nan
primly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apply to a wood nymph for board! Absurd!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all! Of course, I can&rsquo;t take you to
board without knowing your name and&mdash;er&mdash;number.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you must, you must&mdash;Tom Smith is
my name&mdash;as for my number&mdash;there is only one
of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean by your number, where you live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I live in the air mostly. Sometimes I
come down to have some washing done and to
vote&mdash;at least, I came down once to vote&mdash;that
was last June, but as no elections were going on
just then and as my having arrived at the age of
twenty-one did not seem to make them hurry, I
went up in the air again. When I do vote,
though, it will be out in Louisville, Kentucky.
That&rsquo;s where I have my washing done. You
don&rsquo;t say what you think of such a name as Tom
Smith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not very&mdash;romantic, but it must have
been a nice name to go to school with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great! There were so many of us that the
lickings didn&rsquo;t go round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl was leading the way down the mountain
path and they came to the spring where she
had performed her ablutions earlier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the fountain of Pirene.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I fancied we would come to it soon,&rdquo;
and he stooped and drank his fill, shaking the
drops from his crisp curls as he got up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love to drink that way,&rdquo; cried Nan. &ldquo;I had
a big deep drink as I went up the mountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you drink that way! How else
could a wood nymph drink? You might make a
cup of your little brown hand, but even that is
almost too modern. Ah, there is the camp! How
jolly it looks! Are there any people there? It
looks so quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any people there? Quiet! It is running over
with people. They are all asleep now, that is the
reason it is so quiet. There will be noise enough
later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she spoke there were shouts from the shower
bath where some of the youths from the camp
had assembled for a community shower, and as
the cold mountain water struck them they certainly
made the welkin ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is father! Come, and I&rsquo;ll introduce
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Carter was coming from the kitchen bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
a cup of coffee for his wife, who stuck to the
New Orleans habit of black coffee the first thing
in the morning, and Mr. Carter loved to be the
one to take it to her bedside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father, this is Mr. Bel&mdash;Smith. He flew
over here this morning,&rdquo; and Nan suddenly remembered
that she was not a wood nymph and
that this mountain in Albemarle was not Helicon.
Also that it was not a very usual thing for well-brought-up
young ladies to go flying with strange
young men before breakfast, even if strange
young men did almost have Greek profiles. For
the first time that morning Nan blushed. Her
shyness returned. She could hardly believe that
it was she, Nan Carter, who had been so bold.
Her Bellerophon was plain Tom Smith and Pegasus
was a very modern flying machine lying
up in Josephus&rsquo;s pasture, that pasture on top of
a prosaic mountain in Albemarle County and not
Mount Helicon. The fountain of Pirene was
nothing but the spring that fed the reservoir
from which they got the water supply for the
shower bath where those boys were making such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
an unearthly racket. She was not a wood nymph&mdash;there
were no wood nymphs&mdash;but just a sentimental
little girl of sixteen who no doubt needed
a good talking to and a reprimand for being so
very imprudent. What would her mother say to
such an escapade?</p>

<p>With all of Mrs. Carter&rsquo;s delicate spirituelle
appearance there was nothing poetical in her
make-up. She would never understand this talk
of forgetting that one was not a wood nymph.
There was more chance of the father&rsquo;s sympathy.
Nan took the bull by the horns and
plunged into her confession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father, I have been up in Mr. Bel&mdash;Smith&rsquo;s
flying machine. I don&rsquo;t know what made me do
it except I just&mdash;it was so early&mdash;I&mdash;I forgot it
wasn&rsquo;t a flying horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Carter looked at his little daughter with
a smile of extreme tenderness. He had taken
flights on Pegasus himself in days gone by. He
seldom mounted him now&mdash;the burden of making
a living had almost made him forget that
Pegasus was not a plough horse&mdash;not quite, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and now as his little girl stood in front of
him, her hair all ruffled by her flight, her cheeks
flushed and in her great brown eyes the shadow
of her dream, he understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is still early in the morning, honey, for you&mdash;no
doubt the aeroplane is Pegasus. I envy you
the experience. Everyone might not see it as I
do, however, so you and Mr. Belsmith and I had
better keep it to ourselves,&rdquo; and he shook the
birdman&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Smith is my name&mdash;Tom Smith,&rdquo; and the
young man smiled into the eyes of the older man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very glad to see you, and just as soon
as I take this coffee to my wife, I will come and
do the honors of the camp,&rdquo; and Robert Carter
hastened off, thinking what a boon it would be to
be young again in this day of flying machines.</p>

<p>Nan found her tent about as she had left it.
The inmates were still asleep. &ldquo;How strange,&rdquo;
she said to herself, &ldquo;that I should have been to
the top of Helicon and taken flight with Bellerophon
on Pegasus while these girls have slept on
not knowing a thing about it! I wonder where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
their astral bodies have been! Douglas looks so
happy, poor dear, I fancy hers has been in
heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aloud she cried: &ldquo;Get up, girls! Wake up!
It is awfully late&mdash;the camp is stirring and there
is a lot to do. I have found a new boarder! He
dropped from the clouds and is starved to
death.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<span class="f8">PLEASE REMIT</span></h2>


<p>Of course everyone was vastly interested in
Mr. Tom Smith and his aeroplane. That young
man, however, exhibited a modest demeanor
which was very pleasant to members of his sex.
He promised to take any and all of the campers
flying if his machine was in good order. He
thought it needed a little tinkering, however, as
he had noticed a little clicking sound above the
usual clack and hum of the motor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How on earth did you happen to land here?&rdquo;
asked someone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Airman&rsquo;s instinct, I reckon. I was looking
for the camp and had heard there was a mountain
with a smooth plateau around here somewhere.
A place to land is our biggest problem.
The time will come when there will be landing
stations for flyers just as they have tea houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
for automobilists now. There is great danger of
becoming entangled in trees and telegraph wires.
A place looks pretty good for lighting when you
are up in the clouds and then when you get down
you find what seemed to be a smooth, grassy
plain is perhaps the top of a scrub oak forest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After breakfast the whole camp of week-enders
marched to the top of the mountain to view
the great bird, but the Carter girls had to stay
behind to prepare for the picnic. Many sandwiches
must be made and the baskets packed.
Nan had her usual bowl of mayonnaise to stir.
She looked very demure in her great apron but
her eyes were dancing with the remembrance of
her morning&rsquo;s escapade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look very perky this morning, honey,&rdquo;
said Douglas, as she packed a basket of turnovers
and cheese cakes with great care not to
crush those wonders of culinary art.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look tolerable perky yourself,&rdquo; retorted
her sister. Just as the sophomores and seniors
of a college seem to fraternize, so it is often the
case with the first and third members of a family.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Douglas and Nan hit it off better with one
another than they did with either Helen or Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel like flying!&rdquo; declared Douglas. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t mean in an aeroplane but just of my own
accord. I am so happy that mother has given up
that terrible plan for me, given it up without
father&rsquo;s knowing anything about it. I wish I
knew who had persuaded her or how it came
about. She is rather&mdash;well, not exactly cold with
me&mdash;but not exactly chummy. She has not told
me yet, but if you say it is so, I know it is so. I
went to her room this morning so she could tell
me if she wanted to, but she didn&rsquo;t say a thing
about it. She got a lot of letters from New York
by the early mail. I am mighty afraid they are
bills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty apt to be,&rdquo; sighed Nan. &ldquo;I hope she
won&rsquo;t give them to father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she mustn&rsquo;t do that. I shall have to ask
her for them. I hate to do it. She thinks I am
so stern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me do it,&rdquo; said Nan magnanimously. &ldquo;I
wonder how much they amount to.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nan! Would you mind asking for
them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am not crazy about it, but I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo;
and do it she did.</p>

<p>She found her mother in a dainty negligee
writing notes at a little desk her devoted husband
had fashioned from a packing box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Nan, how sweet of you to come to me!
I see so little of my girls now, they are so occupied
with outside interests. Here, child, just run
these ribbons in my underwear. It really takes
a great deal of time to keep one&rsquo;s clothes in order.
Susan should do such things for me, but she is
constantly being called off to do other things, at
least she says she is. What, I can&rsquo;t for the life
of me see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan dutifully began to do her mother&rsquo;s bidding,
but when she saw the drawer full of things
she was supposed to decorate with ribbons she
had to call a halt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry, mumsy, but I am helping
Douglas pack the lunch baskets. This is a day
for a picnic, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t know. Who is going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everyone, we hope, as that gives Oscar and
Susan a chance to get a thorough cleaning done,
with no dinner to cook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how absurdly practical you girls have become!
I just hate it in you. What business has
a girl of your age to know about who does thorough
cleaning and when it is done?&rdquo; Nan restrained
a giggle. She had come to a full realization
of what a very frivolous person her little
mother was and while it made her sad in a way
it also touched her sense of humor irresistibly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am deeply disappointed in the fact that
Douglas is not to come out next winter. Mr.
Parker advises me strongly against trying to
launch her. He says there are so many debutantes
already and that he is engaged up to every
dance and that all of the dancing men are in the
same fix. Of course if I should go against his
advice Douglas would fall as flat as possible.
She has no desire to come out as it is and no
doubt would do nothing to further her cause. I
do not feel equal to the task of bringing her out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and of putting spirit into her at the same time.
She has been so lifeless and listless lately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan smiled, thinking of how she had left
Douglas actually dancing as she packed the
goodies and smiling all over her happy face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a lot of letters you have, mumsy! You
are almost as busy as I am with letters. It takes
me hours every day answering applications for
board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I have many notes to answer&mdash;friends,
welcoming me back to Virginia. This
pile over here is nothing but bills&mdash;things bought
in New York, on my way home. I think it is
most impertinent of these tradespeople to send
them so promptly. They were so eager for me to
open accounts, and now they write to me as
though I were a pickpocket. &lsquo;Please Remit&rsquo; at
the bottom of every bill, and one man actually
accuses me of being slow in payment. He says
he understood I was to send money as soon as I
reached Virginia. I have no money myself. I
shall just have to hand them over to your
father&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother, please don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not? How else am I to get them paid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, mother, the doctor said no money matters
must be brought to father for at least a year
and maybe not then. It was bills that made him
ill, and bills would be so bad for him now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bills, indeed! It was overwork! I did my
best to make him relax and not work so hard, but
he would not listen to me. Many a time I tried
to make him stop and go to the opera with me or
to receptions, but it was always work, work,
work!&mdash;day and night. I&rsquo;m sure no one can accuse
me of selfishness in the matter&mdash;I did my
best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, I know you did,&rdquo; said Nan solemnly
and gently, as though she were soothing a
little child who had dropped a bowl of goldfish
or done something equally disastrous and equally
irreparable. &ldquo;I tell you what you do, though,
honey, you give me the bills. You see, I write
all the letters for the camp and I will attend to
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter handed over the offensive pile of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
envelopes with an air of washing her hands of
the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one thing, mumsy: if I were you,
I&rsquo;d withdraw my patronage from such persons.
I&rsquo;d never favor tradespeople like these with another
order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; exclaimed the mother. &ldquo;&lsquo;Please Remit,&rsquo;
indeed! I never imagined such impertinence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan bore off the sheaf of bills. They were
not quite so large as they had feared. Mrs. Carter
had unwittingly managed very well since she
had accidentally struck August sales in New
York and the things she had bought really were
bargains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will pay them immediately, Nan,&rdquo; said
Douglas. &ldquo;I am so thankful that father did not
see them. It would be so hard on him that I am
sure much of the good that has come to him from
the long rest would be done away with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they make you blue, these bills?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed! Nothing will make me blue now
that mother has given up making me be a debutante.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
I can go on working and make more
money to take the place of this we shall have to
take out of the bank to pay for these things
mother bought. But just suppose she had carried
her point and forced me into society. I
could have earned no money and would have had
such a lot spent on me. Why can&rsquo;t she see,
Nan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is color blind, I think, unless it is couleur
de rose. We must be patient with her, Douglas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, grandma!&rdquo; And if Mrs. Carter
could have heard the peal of laughter from
Douglas, she would not have thought her lifeless
and listless. &ldquo;You are such a dear little wise old
lady, Nan!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<span class="f8">TEAKETTLE</span></h2>


<p>The fallen tree where Nan and Dum Tucker
had chosen to have the picnic proved to be most
attractive. It was a great oak that had attained
its growth before it had been felled in some wind
storm, and now it lay like some bed-ridden old
giant who refuses to die. Part of the roots held
to the soil while part stood up like great toes,
poking their way through the blanket of ferns
and moss that were doing their best to cover
them. This tree not only clung to its old
branches but had actually the hardihood to send
out new shoots. These branches were not growing
as the limbs of an oak usually grow, with a
slightly downward tendency from the main
trunk, but shot straight to the sky, upright and
vigorous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is just like some old man who has to stay
in bed but still is open to convictions of all kinds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
who reads and takes in new ideas and is willing
to try new things and think new thoughts,&rdquo; suggested
Page Allison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that strong green branch struggling to
the light there might be equal suffrage,&rdquo; teased
Mr. Tucker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and that one that has outstripped all the
others is higher education of women,&rdquo; declared
Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These little ferns and wild flowers that are
trying to cover up his ugly old toes are modern
verse. He even reads the poetry of the day and
does not just lie back on stuffy old pillows and
insist that poetry died with Alfred Tennyson,&rdquo;
whispered Nan, who did not like much to speak
out loud in meetin&rsquo;. Tom Smith heard her, however,
and smiled his approval of her imagery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I only hope while we are picnicking on
his bed he won&rsquo;t decide to turn over and go to
sleep. It would certainly play sad havoc with
cheese cakes,&rdquo; laughed Helen.</p>

<p>Much to the satisfaction of the Carter girls,
all the week-enders did decide to come on the picnic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
also their mother. They knew very well
that had that lady made up her mind to remain
in camp, Susan&rsquo;s time would have been taken up
waiting on her and the thorough cleaning that
the pavilion and kitchen were crying out for
would never be accomplished.</p>

<p>Mr. Hiram G. Parker, in faultless morning
costume, had proffered himself as squire of
dames and was assisting that dainty little lady
on the rough journey to the fallen tree. She,
too, had attired herself with thoughtful care in
sheer white linen lawn with a large picture hat
of finest straw and a ruffled lace parasol. The
girls were in strong contrast to their chaperone,
since one and all, even Tillie Wingo, were
dressed in khaki skirts and leggins. The only
variation in costume was that some wore middies
and some sport shirts.</p>

<p>First a fire must be built and a big one at that,
as it takes many hot coals to roast potatoes. Lucy
and Lil Tate, with their faithful followers,
Skeeter and Frank, had gone on a little ahead,
and when the rest of the crowd reached the spot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the fire was already burning merrily. In a short
time it was ready to drop the potatoes in, Irish
potatoes and great yams that looked big enough
for the bed-ridden giant himself to make a meal
of. Then the roasting ears of corn must be
opened, the silk removed and the ears wrapped
carefully in the shucks again and placed in just
exactly the right part of the fire to cook but not
to burn.</p>

<p>There was some kind of work for all of those
inclined to usefulness, and any who were not so
inclined could wander around admiring the scenery
or climb up in the tree to secure the choice
seats. There were seats for all and to spare in
the gnarled old limbs of the giant oak. Mrs.
Carter was enthroned in a leafy armchair while
Hiram G. perched beside her. Evidently he was
prepared to be waited on and not to wait. Bobby
climbed to the tiptop of one of the great branches
where he looked like a &ldquo;little cherub that sits up
aloft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-gonter let down a string and pull my
eats up here,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bobby!&rdquo; shuddered his mother. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
say such words!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I done now?&rdquo; cried that young hopeful,
peeping down through the leafy screen, with
an elfish, toothless grin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say eats! Say luncheon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I won&rsquo;t! If I say luncheon, they&rsquo;ll send
me up &rsquo;bout &rsquo;nough to put in my eye. I&rsquo;ve a
great mind to say victuals like Oscar and then
they&rsquo;ll send me up something sho&rsquo;. Hi, Helen!
Put my victuals in a bucket and tie it to this
string!&rdquo; he cried, dangling a string before
Helen&rsquo;s eyes as she stooped under the tree, unpacking
the basket containing the paper plates
and Japanese napkins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t put anything in the bucket unless you
mind mother,&rdquo; said Helen severely, but her eye
was twinkling at Bobby&rsquo;s philological distinction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, Helen dear, be so kind as to put
my luncheon in that there little bucket what you
see turned up over yonder by the fire. But,
Helen,&rdquo; in a stage whisper, &ldquo;please don&rsquo;t put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
it in like a luncheon but like it was jes&rsquo; victuals.
Luncheons ain&rsquo;t never &rsquo;nough for workin&rsquo; mens.&rdquo;
So all in good time Helen packed a hefty lunch in
the bucket for her darling and he drew it up to
his castle in the tree and feasted right royally.</p>

<p>When everyone was too hungry to stand it another
moment the potatoes were done, all burnt
on the outside and delicious and mealy within.
There never were such sandwiches as Helen&rsquo;s;
and the corn, roasted in the shucks, was better
than corn ever had been before. The cheese
cakes and fried turnovers proved very good for
tree eating and not too squashy. Boxes of candy
appeared like magic from the pockets of masculine
week-enders. Mr. Tucker produced three,
one for each of his girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Zebedee!&rdquo; exclaimed Dum. &ldquo;I am so
relieved. I thought you were getting hippy. It
was candy all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When every vestige of food was devoured and
all the paper plates and papers carefully burned,
as Nan said, to keep from desecrating Nature,
someone proposed that they should play games.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s play teakettle!&rdquo; exclaimed Skeeter, so
teakettle it was. Some of the company had to be
enlightened as to the game and perhaps some of
my readers may have to be also. This is the way:
whoever is &ldquo;It&rdquo; or &ldquo;Old Man&rdquo; must go out of
ear shot and then the company selects a word.
The &ldquo;Old Man&rdquo; then returns and asks a question
to each one in turn. The answer must contain
the chosen word, but in place of the word, &ldquo;teakettle&rdquo;
must be inserted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go out, Zebedee, you are so spry,&rdquo; suggested
the irreverent Dum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not fair! We must count out,&rdquo; declared
Dee, determined that her parent must be
bossed only by her own sweet self.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bid to count!&rdquo; from Lucy. &ldquo;&lsquo;Eny, meny,
miny mo, cracker, feny, finy, fo, ommer noocher,
popper toocher, rick, bick, ban, do, as, I, went, up
the, apple, tree, all, the, apples, fell, on, me, bake
a, pudding, bake, a, pie, did, you, ever, tell, a,
lie, yes, you, did, you, know, you, did, you, broke,
your, mammy&rsquo;s, tea, pot, lid, did, she, mind?&rsquo;&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
She stopped at Lil Tate, who was equal to the
occasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Lil; and Lucy took up her counting
out in the sing-song we hear from children
engaged in that delightful occupation of finding
out who is to be &ldquo;It.&rdquo; No matter where one
lives&mdash;east, west, north or south&mdash;it is the same
except for slight variations in the sense of the
incantation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;N, o, spells, the, word, no, and, you, are,
really&mdash;It!&rdquo; An accusing finger was pointed at
Nan, who perforce must crawl from her comfortable
perch and go around the side of the
mountain while the assembled company chose a
word.</p>

<p>After much whispering, Mr. Tucker hit on a
word that appealed to all of them, and Nan was
whistled for to return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen, what do you enjoy most in camp life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Teakettles!&rdquo; was the prompt response.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Skeeter, did you and Frank get any squirrels
yesterday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not one! We told them if they would let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
us shoot them that they could come with us on
the picnic&mdash;but they said: no teakettles for
them!&rdquo; Indignant cries from Skeeter&rsquo;s chums
ensued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You came mighty near giving us away, you
nut!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan thought a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it pies? Helen certainly enjoys pies, and
if the squirrels had come on the picnic it would
have been in a pie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; guess again! Guess again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, are you comfortable up there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear; I had no idea one could have
an armchair at a teakettle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Picnic!&rsquo; &lsquo;Picnic!&rsquo; I know that is the word.
Mumsy gave it away. You have to go out,
mumsy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Picnic&rdquo; was the word and everyone thought
Nan very clever to guess it so quickly. Mrs.
Carter was loath to leave her leafy bower, so
Mr. Parker gallantly offered to take her place
and be &ldquo;It.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>A word was quickly chosen for Mr. Parker
although they feared it would be too easy. That
gentleman was really enjoying himself very
much. Climbing trees was not much in his line,
but he congratulated himself that while his suit
no doubt looked perfectly new, it was in reality
three years old and was only his eighteenth best.
The lapels were a little smaller than the prevailing
mode and the coat cut away a bit more than
the latest fashion. He could not wear it much
longer, anyhow, and in the meantime he was
having a very pleasant time. The girls were a
ripping lot and he would no doubt have the pleasure
of bringing them out in years to come. He
might even stretch a point and ask some of them
to dance the german with him before they made
their debuts. That little Allison girl from the
country was a charmer and as for the Tucker
twins&mdash;the only trouble about them was he could
not decide which one would take the better in society.
Helen Carter was sure to win in whatever
class she entered. Douglas Carter had deceived
him somewhat. The evening before, while looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
very pretty she had lacked animation. He
had been quite serious in his advice to Mrs. Carter
not to bring her out that year. With the
scarcity of beaux only a girl who was all animation
had any show of having a good time in her
debutante year. Now today this girl had thrown
off her listlessness and was as full of life as anyone.
She was really beautiful. If a complexion
could show up as well as hers did in the sunlight
what would it not do in artificial light? And her
hair! Hair like that could stand the test of dancing
all night, and Mr. Hiram G. Parker had
found out from long experience that not much
hair could stand the test.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Always coming out of curl and getting limp!&rdquo;
he muttered, but just then they whistled for him
and he returned to the tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahem! Miss Douglas, are you expecting to
miss the boys who have gone to the border with
the Blues?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo; blushed Douglas; &ldquo;but if I were
a teakettle it would be even worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it a mother? Of course it would be worse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
if you were a mother! Ah, maybe you have
been promising to be a sister to one of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas blushed so furiously that she almost
fell off her precarious perch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mother&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t the word&mdash;neither is &lsquo;sister&rsquo;!&rdquo;
shouted the crowd. &ldquo;Guess again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Dum Tucker, are you going to remain
long in camp?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I shall have to leave on Monday,
but if the teakettle fancier is no longer here, I
don&rsquo;t believe I should care to remain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Teakettle fancier! Sounds like spinsters. I
can&rsquo;t see what it is. Miss Dee, what are these
teakettles like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are as many styles of teakettles as
there are teakettles, tall and narrow, short and
squat, with snouts of all shapes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heavens! Still no light on the subject!
Tucker, what is your opinion of the war? Will
it last much longer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not, although I hear it is an excellent
way to dispose of last year&rsquo;s teakettles. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
are using so many of them in the Red Cross
service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now! I must do better than this.
Mrs. Carter, have you any of these teakettles
about you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Parker, I haven&rsquo;t a single teakettle&mdash;ye-et,&rdquo;
rather sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Smith!&rdquo; That young aviator, not expecting
to be called on, almost fell out of the tree,
which would have been an ignominious proceeding
for one accustomed to the dizzy heights of
the clouds. &ldquo;Do you come across any of this
stuff, whatever it is that these crazy folks call
teakettles?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do occasionally. Even here in this
camp there is a lot of the stuff that teakettles are
made of&mdash;the raw material, I might say, but if I
should, no doubt future teakettles would climb
up the tree and mob me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Debutantes!&rsquo; &lsquo;Debutantes!&rsquo; That is the word!
Stupid of me not to guess it sooner. Thank you,
Miss Dum, for the compliment you just paid me,
or did you mean your father? Because I understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
that he is somewhat fond of young
girls himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I meant you in the game&mdash;but Zebedee in
reality,&rdquo; declared Dum, who had no more idea of
coquetting than a real teakettle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Smith is &lsquo;It&rsquo;!&rdquo; shouted Lucy. &ldquo;We are
going to get a hard one for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Skeeter wanted to take &ldquo;flying machine&rdquo; but
that was too easy. Many suggestions were made
but Nan finally hit on a word that they were sure
he could never guess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The trouble is it is hardly fair to take a word
that is so obscure,&rdquo; objected Mr. Carter, who
had been quietly enjoying the fun as much as
any of the party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it is a compliment to give him a hard
one,&rdquo; declared Mr. Tucker. &ldquo;It means we have
some reliance on his wit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom Smith was proving himself a very agreeable
companion and old and young were feeling
him to be an acquisition to the camp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You youngsters up there in the top of the
tree, come down and be questioned!&rdquo; cried the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
&ldquo;Old Man.&rdquo; &ldquo;You, Bobby, what are you doing
up there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-playin&rsquo; I&rsquo;m one er them there teakettles,&rdquo;
said that ready-witted infant. Everyone
shouted for joy at his answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, Frank Maury! Do you want to
take a trip with me some day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure! I&rsquo;d ruther be a birdman than&mdash;a&mdash;teakettle,&rdquo;
said Frank lamely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see one of these teakettles,
Skeeter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw, and nobody else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t use the word, Skeeter,&rdquo; admonished
Lil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you use it for him,&rdquo; suggested the questioner.
&ldquo;I take it then if he never saw a teakettle
and no one else has ever seen one, that it is
some kind of mythological creature. Am I
right?&rdquo; he appealed, following up the advantage
Skeeter had given him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a teakettle is a mythological being,&rdquo; said
Lil primly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Skeeter can give more things away without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
using the word than most folks can using it,&rdquo;
declared Lucy cruelly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Nan, did I ever see a teakettle that you
know of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have an idea you thought you saw a teakettle
once,&rdquo; drawled Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wood nymph!&rsquo;&rdquo; exclaimed Tom Smith.</p>

<p>Everyone thought he was very clever to have
guessed a very difficult and obscure word in five
questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan&rsquo;s turn again! That isn&rsquo;t fair when
Skeeter really and truly was the one who got him
going. You&rsquo;ve got to go, Skeeter,&rdquo; and Frank
and Lil and Lucy pounced on their chum and
dragged him from the tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I haven&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;d never guess c-a-t. Get
somebody else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; Mr. Tucker volunteered magnanimously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him; he&rsquo;s dying to!&rdquo; exclaimed the twins
in one breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t tweedle!&rdquo; commanded their
father. He always called it tweedling when his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
twins spoke the same thing at the same time.</p>

<p>A word was hard to hit on because as his
daughters said Mr. Tucker had what men call
feminine intuition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t keep a thing from him,&rdquo; Dum said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And sometimes he sees something before it
happens,&rdquo; declared Dee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, spooks!&rdquo; laughed Page.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Spooks&rsquo; would be a good word,&rdquo; suggested
someone, but Mrs. Carter had a word which was
finally determined on. Zebedee was whistled for
and came quickly to the front.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Smith, tell me, while flying through the
air would you like to have one of these teakettles
with you? I mean would it be the kind of
thing you could carry with you? Would it be
of any value on the journey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;el, I can&rsquo;t say that a teakettle would be
of any great practical value on a flight, but it
would certainly be great to have one. I believe
I&rsquo;d rather have one than anything I can think
of. In fact, I mean to take one with me some
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Tucker looked into the glowing countenance
of the young birdman. He saw there
youth, character, romance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A &lsquo;teakettle&rsquo; is a &lsquo;sweetheart,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Talking about spooks&mdash;what do you know
about that?&rdquo; cried one of the crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what did I tell you? Didn&rsquo;t I say you
couldn&rsquo;t keep anything from Zebedee?&rdquo; said triumphant
Dee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I betcher I ain&rsquo;t a-gonter take no sweetheart
with me when I gits me a arryplane,&rdquo; shouted
Bobby from his vantage ground. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-gonter
take Josh and Josephus, ander&mdash;ander&mdash;father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The picnic in the tree had been a decided success.
It was one more perfect day for the week-enders
to report as worth while to the possible
future boarders. Even Mr. Parker was enthusiastic,
although he was not as a rule much of an
outdoor man. He was conscious of the fact that
he shone in a drawing room, and under the
&ldquo;great eye of Heaven&rdquo; did not amount to quite
so much as he did under electric lights with pink
shades.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<span class="f8">THE FORAGERS</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Miss Douglas, them week-enders done cl&rsquo;ared
the coop. Thain&rsquo;t nary chicken lef&rsquo; standin&rsquo; on
a laig. Looks like these here Hungarians don&rsquo;t
think no mo&rsquo; of &lsquo;vourin&rsquo; a chicken than a turkey
does of gobblin&rsquo; up a grasshopper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of them gone, Oscar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yas&rsquo;m! Thain&rsquo;t hide or har of them lef&rsquo;. If
I hadn&rsquo;t er wrung they necks myself, I would er
thought somethin&rsquo;s been a-ketchin&rsquo; &rsquo;em; but
land&rsquo;s sakes, the way these week-enders do eat
chicken is a caution!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll get our young people to start
out today and find some more for us. A big
crowd will be up on Friday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll be bound they will, and all of them
empty. I should think the railroad cyars would
chawge mo&rsquo; ter haul the folks back from this
here camp than what they do to git &rsquo;em here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
They sho&rsquo; goes back a-weighing mo&rsquo; than what
they do whin they comes a-creepin&rsquo; up the mountain
actin&rsquo; like they ain&rsquo;t never seed a squar&rsquo; meal
in they lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oscar&rsquo;s grumbling on the subject of the
amount of food consumed by the boarders was a
never failing source of amusement to the Carter
girls. They were never so pleased as when the
boarders were hungry and enjoyed the food. No
doubt Oscar was pleased, too, but he was ever
outwardly critical of the capacity of the week-enders.</p>

<p>Lucy and Lil, Skeeter and Frank were delighted
to be commissioned to go hunting for food.
Many were the adventures they had while out on
these foraging parties and many the tales they
had to tell of the inhabitants of the mountain
cabins. There were several rules they must obey
and besides those they had perfect liberty to do
as they felt like. The first rule was that they
must wear thick boots and leggins on these
tramps. The snake bite Helen had got early in
the summer had been a lesson learned in time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and now all the campers were made to comply
with the rule of leggins whenever they went on
hikes. The second rule was that they must be
home before dark and must report to Douglas or
Helen as soon as they got home. The third was
that they must tell all their adventures to one of
the older girls. If they obeyed these three rules
they were sure to get into no trouble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fix us up a big lunch, please, Helen. We
are going &rsquo;way far off. There&rsquo;s a man on the far
side of Old Baldy that Josh says has great big
frying-sizers,&rdquo; declared Lil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, be sure you are back before dark,&rdquo; admonished
Helen, in her grownupest tone, according
to Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Miss Grandma, but I don&rsquo;t see why
I have to get in before dark if you don&rsquo;t. You
know you and Doctor Wright came in long after
supper one night&mdash;said you got lost, but you can
tell that to the marines,&rdquo; said Lucy pertly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just for that, I&rsquo;ve a great mind to put red
pepper in your sandwiches,&rdquo; said Helen, blushing
in spite of herself.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose if we get lost, we won&rsquo;t have
to get in before dark, either,&rdquo; teased Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but don&rsquo;t you get lost. Douglas and I
are always a bit uneasy until you are back, as it
is,&rdquo; pleaded Helen. &ldquo;You know mother would
have a fit if you were out late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t listen to her, Miss Helen. We&rsquo;ll
take care of the girls and bring &rsquo;em back safe.
Frank and I couldn&rsquo;t get lost on these mountains
if we tried,&rdquo; and Skeeter drew himself up to his
full height, which was great for a boy of fifteen
and seemed even greater because of his extreme
leanness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we take our guns, Miss Helen?&rdquo; pleaded
Frank.</p>

<p>There was another rule that the boys must not
take the guns if the girls were along. Guns are
safe enough if there are no bystanders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Frank, ask Douglas! I am afraid to be
the one to let you do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I tell her you say yes if she does?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I reckon so! But if she does say yes,
please be awfully careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure we will! I tell you, Miss Helen, if anything
happens to these girls, Skeeter and I&rsquo;d
never show our faces in camp again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you will look after them,&rdquo; said Helen.
These boys were great favorites with Helen, and
they admired her so extravagantly that sometimes
Lil and Lucy, their sworn chums, were a
bit jealous. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made your kind of sandwiches,
Frank, sardines. And I&rsquo;ve stuffed some eggs
with minced ham the way you like them,
Skeeter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bully!&rdquo; exclaimed both knights.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I s&rsquo;pose what Lil and I like or don&rsquo;t like
didn&rsquo;t enter your head,&rdquo; pouted Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Lucy, you know you like sardine sandwiches
better than anything, you said so yourself,&rdquo;
admonished Lil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen didn&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t like what I put up, you can do it
yourself next time,&rdquo; snapped Helen.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0c">&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis dog&rsquo;s delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bark and bite,&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>sang Douglas, coming into the kitchen to spy out
the nakedness of the land preparatory to sending
her order for provisions to the wholesale grocer
in Richmond. &ldquo;What are you girls scrapping
about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucy&rsquo;s always&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I haven&rsquo;t a doubt of it,&rdquo; laughed the
elder sister, who was ever the peacemaker. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t a doubt that Helen did say it, but she
was just joking, and I know Lucy is always trying
to help and is a dear girl. Now you children
trot along and bring back all the chickens you
can carry. Have you got your bags?&rdquo; Gunnysacks
were always taken to bring home the provender.
&ldquo;And money to pay for the chickens? If
you see any eggs, buy them, and more roasting
ears, but don&rsquo;t try to carry everything you see.
Have the mountaineers bring them to camp.
Good-bye! Be sure to come back before dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask her about the guns,&rdquo; whispered Frank to
Lil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Douglas, can the boys take their guns?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Helen says she says yes if you say yes. They
won&rsquo;t carry &rsquo;em loaded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;ll, I believe we can trust you; but do be
careful, boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a whoop the boys flew to their tent for
the guns. The sizable lunch was dumped in the
bottom of a gunnysack and slung over Skeeter&rsquo;s
shoulder, and the cavalcade started, after many
admonitions from Douglas and Helen to be careful
of their guns and to come back before dark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t they the scared cats, though?&rdquo; laughed
Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; what on earth could happen to us?&rdquo; said
Lil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, I reckon, with Skeeter and me here
to protect you&mdash;eh, Skeeter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just guess we could hold a whole litter of
bears at bay with these guns. I almost wish we
would run into some kind of trouble just so
Frank and I could show your big sisters we are
responsible parties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe we will,&rdquo; and Lil danced in glee at
the possible chance of getting into trouble so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
their devoted swains could extricate them.
&ldquo;Maybe we will meet a drunken mountaineer&mdash;or
maybe it will be a whole lot of drunken mountaineers,
a camp of moonshiners&mdash;maybe they
will capture Lucy and me and carry us to their
mountain fastness and there hold us for ransom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh! And what do you think Skeeter and
I&rsquo;ll be doing while they are carrying you off?&rdquo;
sniffed Frank. &ldquo;Standing still, I reckon, and
weeping down our gun barrels!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, s&rsquo;pose they are all of them armed
to the teeth, a company of stalwart brigands,&rdquo;
suggested Lil, who, by the way, was something
of a movie fan, &ldquo;and they come swooping
down on us, the leader bearing a lasso in his
brawny hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; put in Lucy, &ldquo;and he will swirl it
around and will catch both of you in the same
coil and then will tie you to a tree there to await
his pleasure. I think there had better be two
leaders, though, Lil. So you can have one and
I can have one. I bid for the biggest.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Bid for him! If you girls don&rsquo;t beat all! I
do believe you would like to be attacked by outlaws,&rdquo;
and Skeeter looked his disgust at the eternal
feminine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;d like it if it came out all right;
that is, if the leaders fell in love with us and
reformed and turned out to be gentlemen who
took to moonshining and highwaying because
they had been cheated out of their inheritances
by fat-faced uncles in Prince Albert coats,&rdquo; and
Lil looked very saucy as she switched on ahead
of the others down the narrow trail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where would we come in?&rdquo; asked Frank
whimsically. &ldquo;We would have to stay tied to
the tree while you and Lucy acted about a thousand
feet of reels. I tell you what I mean to do.
I mean to train a squirrel to come gnaw me free.
What you say to that, Skeeter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Squirrel much! I&rsquo;m going to be so quick
with my gun that the bold brigands will wish
they had stayed with Uncle Albert. As for lassoing&mdash;I
am some pumpkins myself with the
rope. Look at this!&rdquo; and twirling the gunnysack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
around with the lunch serving as ballast, Skeeter
caught his chum neatly around the neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh! You&rsquo;ll mash the sandwiches!&rdquo;
wailed the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit down and eat &rsquo;em up now,&rdquo; suggested
Skeeter. &ldquo;I am tired of being made the
beast of burden. I believe in distribution of labor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Skeeter, we haven&rsquo;t walked a mile yet,
and it can&rsquo;t be more than ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, my tumtum must be fast. I shall
have to regulate it. It tells me it is almost
twelve.&rdquo; No one had a watch so there was no
way to prove the time except by the shadows, and
Skeeter declared that the shadows on the mountain
perforce must slant even at twelve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s eat part of the lunch,&rdquo; suggested Lucy.
&ldquo;That will keep poor Skeeter from starving and
lighten the load some, too. There is no telling
what time it is, but if we are hungry I can&rsquo;t see
that it makes much difference what time it is.
I&rsquo;m starved myself almost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, too,&rdquo; chorused the others.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>They ate only half, prudently putting the rest
back in the gunnysack for future reference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, I feel some better,&rdquo; sighed Skeeter,
whose appetite was ever a marvel to his friends
since it never seemed to have the slightest effect
on his extreme leanness. Oscar always said:
&ldquo;That there young Marster Skeeter eats so much
it makes him po&rsquo; to carry it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you boys know exactly where we are going?&rdquo;
asked Lil. They had walked a long distance
since the distribution of burdens and now
had come to a place where the trail went directly
down the mountainside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we do! Josh said that when we
got to a place where the path suddenly went down
we were almost over the cabin where Jude Hanford
lives. Didn&rsquo;t he, Frank?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He sure did!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there was a place back further where a
path forked off. I saw it, didn&rsquo;t you, Lucy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I thought it was maybe just a
washed place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is right, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Skeeter confidently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
so the young people clambered down the
mountainside following Skeeter&rsquo;s lead. The
path went almost exactly perpendicularly
down the mountain for fifty yards and then, as is
the way with mountain paths, it changed its
mind and started up the mountain again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a terribly silly path,&rdquo; declared the self-constituted
guide, &ldquo;but I reckon it will start down
again soon. Josh said that Jude Hanford lives
almost at the foot of the mountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep a-going; there&rsquo;s no use in turning
back,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;This path is obliged to lead
somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it leads to the brigand&rsquo;s cave,&rdquo; shivered
Lil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which way is home?&rdquo; asked Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Due north from here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But as the three of her companions all pointed
in different directions, Lucy laughed at them and
chose an entirely different point of the compass
as her idea of where Camp Carter was situated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
They had been walking for hours and as far as
they could tell had not got off of their own mountain.
No one seemed to be the least worried
about being lost, so Lucy calmed her fears, which
were not very great. How could they get lost?
All they had to do was retrace their steps if they
did not find Jude Hanford&rsquo;s cabin, where the
frying-sized chickens and the roasting ears were
supposed to thrive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s eat again,&rdquo; suggested the ever empty
Skeeter.</p>

<p>They had come to a wonderful mountain
stream, one they had never seen before in their
rambles. It came dashing down the incline singing
a gay song until it found a temporary resting
place in a deep hole which seemed to be hollowed
out of the living rock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a place to swim!&rdquo; they exclaimed in a
breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bet it&rsquo;s cold, though, cold as flugians.&rdquo; Lil
trailed her fingers through the icy water and a
little fish rose to the surface and gave a nibble.
&ldquo;Look! Look! Isn&rsquo;t he sweet?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s fish,&rdquo; suggested Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fish with what? Guns?&rdquo; asked Skeeter
scornfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, fishing lines with minnows for bait,&rdquo; and
Lucy found a pin in her middy blouse and with
a narrow pink ribbon drawn mysteriously from
somewhere tied to the pin, which she bent into a
fine hook, she got ready for the gentle art. A
sardine from a sandwich made excellent bait, at
least the speckled beauties in that pool thought so
as they rose to it greedily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;E&mdash;e-ee!&rdquo; squealed Lucy, flopping an eight-inch
trout out on the bank. &ldquo;I caught a fish! I
caught a fish!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, gimme a pin, please,&rdquo; begged the boys,
so Lucy and Lil had to find fish hooks for their
cavaliers and more strings and in a short while
all of them were eagerly fishing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw such tame fish in all my life,&rdquo;
said Frank. &ldquo;They are just begging to be
caught. It seems not very sporty to hook them
in, somehow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know there were any trout in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
streams. Doctor Wright says there used to be
but the natives have about exterminated them.
Gee, there&rsquo;s a beaut!&rdquo; and Skeeter flopped a mate
to Lucy&rsquo;s catch out on the grass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stop fishing and fry these,&rdquo; he suggested,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hungry! Oh, Skeeter! I&rsquo;m right uneasy
about you,&rdquo; teased Lil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I never did think sandwiches were
very filling. Somehow they don&rsquo;t stick to your
ribs. Come on, Frank, we can get a fire in no
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can we fry anything without lard and a
pan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we won&rsquo;t fry, we&rsquo;ll broil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We, indeed!&rdquo; sniffed Lucy. &ldquo;You know
mighty well, you boys, that when cooking time
comes, Lil and I&rsquo;ll have to do it. I know how to
cook fish without a pan&mdash;learned in Camp-Fire
Girls. Just run a green switch through the gills
and lay it across on two pronged sticks stuck up
on each side of the fire. You go on and make
the fire while Lil and I try to catch some more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
fish. I wonder what Doctor Wright will say
when we tell him we caught game fish with a
bent pin tied on lingerie ribbon. He brought up
all kinds of rods and reels and flies and whipped
the streams for miles around and never caught
anything but Helen&rsquo;s veil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The trout seemed to have become sophisticated
when two of their number had been caught and
refused to be hooked any more with bent pins
and lingerie ribbon, although it was pink and
very attractive. The fire went out and Lucy
and Lil had to try a hand at it before it could be
persuaded to burn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks to me like fire-making must be woman&rsquo;s
work because they certainly can do it better
than us men,&rdquo; said Skeeter solemnly, and the
others laughed at him until Lil slipped into the
water. Only one foot got wet, however, so there
was no harm done.</p>

<p>The fire finally burned and the two little fish,
after being scaled and cleaned, were strung
across on a green wand. Of course the fire had
not been allowed to get to the proper state of red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
embers so the fish were well smoked before they
began to cook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Umm! They smell fine!&rdquo; cried the famished
Skeeter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They smell mighty like burnt fish to me,&rdquo; said
Frank.</p>

<p>They tasted very like burnt fish, too, when
they were finally taken from their wand and the
young folks drew up for the feast. They lacked
salt and were burnt at the tail and raw at the
head, but Skeeter picked the bones and pronounced
them prime.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s getting mighty late and we have
not found Jude Hanford&rsquo;s cabin yet. You stop
stuffing now, Skeeter, and let&rsquo;s get along,&rdquo; said
Frank, gathering up the gunnysacks and guns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think we had better cross this
stream?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, if we go back, it will just take us home.
We won&rsquo;t dare show our faces at camp unless we
have at least the promise of some chickens and
roasting ears. I hope to carry back some in the
gunnysacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we must go on,&rdquo; chorused the girls.
&ldquo;We are not one bit tired and if we go on we are
sure to come to Jude&rsquo;s cabin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Go on they did, how far there was no telling.
The path went down, down, down, but led only to
another spring. The boys shot some squirrels
and the girls found a vine laden with fox grapes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get all we can carry so we can make
some jelly. Helen was wishing only the other
day she had some. They make the best jelly
going,&rdquo; said Lucy, and so they pulled all they
could reach and decided the ones that hung too
high would be sour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know I believe it&rsquo;s most supper time&mdash;I&rsquo;m
getting powerful empty,&rdquo; declared the insatiable
Skeeter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Supper time! Nonsense! I betcher &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t
three o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; and Frank peered knowingly at
the sun. &ldquo;That mountain over yonder is so high,
that&rsquo;s the reason the sun is getting behind it. I
betcher anything on top of the mountain it is
as light as midday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do wish we could find Jude&rsquo;s cabin. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
has been the longest walk we ever have taken,&rdquo;
sighed Lil. &ldquo;Not that I am the least bit tired.&rdquo;
Lil was not quite so robust as Lucy, but wild
horses would not drag from her the admission
that she could not keep up with her chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit down a minute and rest,&rdquo; suggested
Frank, &ldquo;and kinder get our bearings. I&rsquo;m not
sure but perhaps it would be less loony if we
start right off for home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sun had set for them and it was growing
quite gloomy down in the valley where the path
had finally led them. Of course they well knew
that it was shining brightly on those who were
so fortunate as to be on the heights, but the
thing is they were in the depths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, let&rsquo;s go home,&rdquo; agreed Skeeter.
&ldquo;We will strike them at supper, I feel sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They retraced their steps, stopping occasionally
to argue about the trail. There seemed to
be a great many more bypaths going up the
mountain than they had noticed going down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is right. I know, because here is the fox
grape vine we stripped on the way down,&rdquo; cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Lucy, when there was more doubt than usual
about whether or not they were on the right road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, more have grown mighty fast,&rdquo; declared
Skeeter. &ldquo;Look, this is still full.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we couldn&rsquo;t reach the high ones and decided
like Brer Fox that they were sour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brer Fox, indeed! That wasn&rsquo;t Brer Fox
but the one in Aesop,&rdquo; laughed Lil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he acted just like Brer Fox would have
acted, anyhow, and I bet Aesop got him from
Uncle Remus. But see, Lil! This isn&rsquo;t the same
vine. We never could have skipped all these
grapes. Only look what beauts!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might just as well pick &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Skeeter,
suiting the action to the word. &ldquo;They might
come in handy later on for eats if we can&rsquo;t find
our way home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not find our way home!&rdquo; scoffed Frank.
&ldquo;Why, home is just over the mountain. All we
have to do is keep straight up and go down on
the other side. These paths have mixed us up
but the mountain is the same old cove. He can&rsquo;t
mix us up.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<span class="f8">BABES IN THE WOOD</span></h2>


<p>The pull up that mountain was about the
hardest one any of those young people had ever
had. As a rule Lil and Lucy required no help
from the boys, as they prided themselves upon
being quite as active as any members of the opposite
sex, but now they were glad of the assistance
the boys shyly offered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just catch on to my belt, Lil; I can pull you
up and carry the grapes and my gun, too,&rdquo; insisted
Frank, while Skeeter made Lucy take hold
of his gun so he could help her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are most to the top now,&rdquo; they encouraged
the girls. Their way lay over rocks and
through brambles, as they had given up trying
to keep to a trail since the trails seemed to lead
nowhere. They argued if they could get to the
top they could see where they were.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>The top was reached, but, strange to say, it
wasn&rsquo;t a top, after all, but just an excrescence
on the side of the mountain, a kind of a hump.
It led down sharply into a dimple covered with
beautiful green grass, and then towering up on
the other side of this dimple was more and more
mountain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, ain&rsquo;t this the limit? I didn&rsquo;t know
there was a place like this on our mountain!&rdquo;
exclaimed Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Th&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t! This is no more our mountain than
I&rsquo;m Josephus,&rdquo; said Skeeter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think we are lost?&rdquo; asked Lil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we are certainly not found,&rdquo; and Skeeter&rsquo;s
young countenance took on a very grim expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody please kick me, and then I&rsquo;ll feel
better,&rdquo; groaned Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why kick you? You didn&rsquo;t lose us; we lost
ourselves,&rdquo; said Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You just say that to keep me from feeling
bad. I said all the time we were on our own
mountain and I was certainly the one to suggest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
our climbing up to the top. I don&rsquo;t see how or
when we managed to get in this mix-up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, we were down at the foot of the
mountain and we must have spilled over on another
one without knowing it. They so kinder
run together at the bottom,&rdquo; soothed Lucy.</p>

<p>Lil was so worn out after the climb that she
could do no more than sink to the ground; but
she smiled bravely at poor self-accusing Frank
as she gasped out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a grand, romantic spot to play &lsquo;Babes
in the Wood&rsquo;! I bid to be a babe and let you
boys be the robins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my opinion it is nobody&rsquo;s fault that we
have got lost, but lost we are. Of course Frank
and I ought to have had more sense, but we
didn&rsquo;t have it, and I reckon what we ain&rsquo;t got
ain&rsquo;t our fault.&mdash;But if it wasn&rsquo;t our fault for
losing you girls, it is sure up to us to get you
home again and now we had better set to it somehow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Skeeter deposited his gunnysack of squirrels
beside the one of grapes and threw himself down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
beside Lil on the green, green grass of the unexpected
dimple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Lil and I are not blaming you. If we
haven&rsquo;t got as much sense as you boys, I dare
one of you to say so. We could have told we
were getting lost just as much as either one of
you, and it is no more your business to get us
home than it is our business to get you home, is
it, Lil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;reckon not,&rdquo; faltered Lil; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve got
to rest a while before I can get myself or anybody
else home.&rdquo; Poor Lil! She was about all
in but she kept up a brave smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There must be water here or this grass would
not be so pizen green in August,&rdquo; said Skeeter.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go find the spring first, Frank.&rdquo; The boys
wanted to get off together to discuss ways and
means and hold a council of war.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Skeeter, what are we going to do?&rdquo;
asked Frank, as they made for a pile of rocks
down in the middle of the dimple, where it
seemed likely a spring might be hidden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Darnifiknow!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know it&rsquo;s &rsquo;most night? I thought
when we got to the top there would be lots of
light, but all the time we were coming up the sun
was going down, and blamed if it hasn&rsquo;t set
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and no moon until &rsquo;most morning. What
will Miss Douglas and Miss Helen say to us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worrying about what they will say,
but what will they think? I am afraid Lil can&rsquo;t
take another step tonight. She is game as game,
but she is just about flopped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might make a basket of our hands and
carry her thataway,&rdquo; suggested Skeeter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we might! Lil is not so big but she is
no dollbaby, and I don&rsquo;t believe we could pack
her a mile if our lives depended on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what will we do? Can you think of
anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think that one of us must stay with
the girls and the other one go snooping around
to try to find somebody, a house, or something.
You stay with them and I&rsquo;ll go. I bid to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All&mdash;right!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>But Skeeter did think, considering he was at
least two months older than Frank and at least
three inches taller, that he should be the one to
go the front. The rôle of home guard did not
appeal to him much, but when a fellow says &ldquo;he
bids to,&rdquo; that settles it.</p>

<p>The spring was found down low between the
rocks&mdash;such a clear, clean spring that even the
greatest germ fearer would not hesitate to drink
of its waters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, there&rsquo;s a little path leading from the
other side! It must go somewhere!&rdquo; cried Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it must go somewhere just as all the
trails we have followed today must&mdash;but where?
Don&rsquo;t tell me about paths! They are frauds, delusions
and snares. I reckon there won&rsquo;t be any
supper for us tonight, so I might just as well
fill up on water,&rdquo; and Skeeter stooped and drank
until his chum became alarmed. Skeeter&rsquo;s capacity
was surely miraculous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not tell the girls we might not be able
to get back before night. It might get them upset,&rdquo;
cautioned Frank.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>They reckoned without their host, however, in
this matter. When the boys returned to the forlorn
damsels bearing a can of water for their refreshment,
the can having been discovered by
the spring, they found them not forlorn at all.
They had spunked up each other and now were
almost lively. Lil was tired and pale and Lucy
had a rather bedraggled look, but they called out
cheerily:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ho, brave knights!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen! Don&rsquo;t you hear a strange sound,
kind of like music without a tune?&rdquo; said Lucy.</p>

<p>There was a sound, certainly. It might be the
wind in the pines and it might be a giant fly buzzing
in a flower that had closed its doors for the
night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is coming closer,&rdquo; cried Lil. &ldquo;Maybe it is
the bold brigands who are to bear us off to captivity
in their mountain fastnesses. I tell you,
if they want me they will have to bear me. I
can&rsquo;t hobble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then there came through the scrub growth
on the opposite side of the green dimple where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
our young people had made their temporary abiding
place, a strange figure. It was a tall, lean
young man dressed in a coat of many colors, a
shirt that seemed to be made of patches, no two
patches of the same color and none of them
matching the original color of the shirt, which
was of a vivid blue. His trousers were of bright
pink calico, the kind you see on the shelves of
country stores and that is usually spoken of as
&ldquo;candy pink.&rdquo; His head was bare; his hair long
and yellow. A large tin bucket was hung on his
arm while he diligently played a jew&rsquo;s-harp.</p>

<p>The effect of this strange figure was so weird
as it appeared through the gathering twilight
that the girls could hardly hold in the screams
that were in their throats. They controlled
them, however, so that they only came out as
faint giggles.</p>

<p>The music of the jew&rsquo;s-harp can be very eyrie
in broad daylight when made by an ordinary human
being; but just at dusk in a mountain fastness
when four young persons have decided they
are lost and may have to spend the night in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
woods, this music, coming from such a strange,
motley figure, seemed positively grewsome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak to it!&rdquo; gasped Lucy.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;Angels and ministers of grace, defend us!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be thou a spirit of health, or goblin damned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring with thee airs from heaven, or blasts from hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be thy intents wicked, or charitable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou com&rsquo;st in such a questionable shape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I will speak to thee,&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>spouted Skeeter.</p>

<p>The youth stood still in his path but went on
with his weird near-tune. Skeeter approached
him and the others followed, although poor Lil
found herself limping painfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, we are lost!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, not lost, for I have found you uns.
We uns is always findin&rsquo;.&rdquo; His voice had an indescribable
softness and gentleness and his blue
eyes a far-away look as though he lived in some
other world. &ldquo;Only t&rsquo;other day we uns &rsquo;most
found a great bird floating in the sky, but it flew
away. We uns thought at first it was lost but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
wasn&rsquo;t. If it had a been lost, we uns would have
found it. A great big bird, bigger&rsquo;n a bald-headed
eagle, bigger&rsquo;n a buzzard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that you have found us, what are you
going to do with us?&rdquo; asked Lil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what we uns finds, we uns hides ag&rsquo;in.
Thar&rsquo;s a hole in the mounting whar we uns puts
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uhhh&mdash;a brigand, sure enough!&rdquo; whispered
Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you wouldn&rsquo;t put us there, because we
are alive. You have a home somewhere near here,
haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Frank. But the half-witted
fellow shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We uns ain&rsquo;t got no mo&rsquo; home since they
came and found my maw&mdash;they came and found
her and hid her in the ground. We uns must
have lost her and never can find her&mdash;but there
are lots of other things to find,&rdquo; and his blue
eyes that had looked all clouded at the sad
thought of never finding his mother, now began
to sparkle. &ldquo;Only this evening we uns found the
prettiest light in the sky&mdash;it&rsquo;s gone now&mdash;gone&mdash;before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
we uns could hide it in the hole, but we
uns will find another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do you live?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Skeeter asked it gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we uns lives with the spring-keeper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The spring-keeper! Who is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we uns found him when they took my
maw! He is a little daffy&mdash;that is what folks
say, but we uns can&rsquo;t see but he is as smart as
them what laughs at him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young people were quite aghast at the
news that the person with whom this strange being
lived was considered daffy. The boys had
their doubts about the advantage of asking shelter
in a house where two crazy people lived, but
perhaps the spring-keeper was not crazy, after
all. This young man certainly seemed harmless
enough, and perhaps he could show them the
way to Greendale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does the spring-keeper live far from here?&rdquo;
asked Lil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, just round the mounting. We uns
will show you uns the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>He filled his bucket at the crystal spring and
then led the way along the narrow path.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who taught you to play the jew&rsquo;s-harp?&rdquo;
asked Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody! We uns just makes the music we
uns finds in the trees. We uns can make the
tune the bee tree makes, too. We uns can do so
many things. We uns made these pants and
every day we uns sews a pretty new color on this
shirt. The spring-keeper fetches pretty cloth
from the store and sometimes we uns sews quilts.
Look, thar&rsquo;s the place whar the spring-keeper
lives when he ain&rsquo;t a-tendin&rsquo; to his
business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is his business?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We uns done told you he&rsquo;s a spring-keeper.
Be you uns daffy, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That made them all laugh, and then the guide
laughed too, delightedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we uns is found some happiness!&rdquo; he
exclaimed. &ldquo;The spring-keeper says that is all
that&rsquo;s worth finding. He says he has found it
but he never laughs like that. He just smiles but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
never makes no music when he&rsquo;s happy. But
neither does the sunshine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cabin which they were approaching was
different in a way from the usual one found in
the mountains. It was made of logs and had the
outline of the ordinary abode of the mountaineer,
but a long porch went along two sides
and this porch was screened. Screening is something
almost unheard-of with the natives, although
the flies abound in the mountains as well
as in the valleys. A little clearing around the
cabin was one great tangle of flowers: golden
glow, love-in-the-mist, four o&rsquo;clocks, bachelor&rsquo;s
buttons, zenias, asters, hollyhocks, sunflowers,
poppies, cornflowers, scarlet sage, roses and honeysuckles.
Some greedy bees were still buzzing
around the roses, although the sun was down
and it was high time all laborers were knocking
off for the night. There was a light in the cabin
which sent a very cheering message to the foot-sore
travelers&mdash;also an odor of cooking that appealed
very strongly to all of them but sent
Skeeter off into an ecstasy of anticipation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>The guide put down his bucket of water and
placing his jew&rsquo;s-harp to his lips gave a kind of
buzzing call. Immediately an old man came out
of the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Tom Tit?&rdquo; It was such a kind,
sweet voice that the four were made sure they
were right in coming to his abode.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Spring-keeper, and we uns found something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be bound you have! What is it this time?
Another aeroplane or a rainbow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it is four laughs, look!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man did look, and when he saw the
wanderers, he hastened out to make them welcome.
Never was there a more charming manner
than his. No wonder the half-witted youth
thought of the sunshine in connection with his
smile.</p>

<p>He was tall and stalwart, with a long gray
beard that could only be equalled by Santa
Claus himself. His hair was silver white and
his cheeks as rosy as a girl would like to have
hers. His eyes were gray and so kind and twinkling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
that all fear of his being crazy was immediately
dispelled from the minds of our young people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They thought they were lost but they were
wrong&mdash;we uns found &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good work, Tom Tit! And now what are
we to do with them?&rdquo; he asked, although he did
not wait to find out what his poor companion had
in his befuddled mind but ushered them to the
porch, where he made the girls comfortable in
steamer chairs and let the boys find seats for
themselves.</p>

<p>Their story was soon told and much was their
amazement to learn that they were more than
ten miles from Greendale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have been walking all day in the
wrong direction. No wonder this poor little girl
is limping. Now the first thing for us to do is to
have something to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo; from Skeeter.</p>

<p>The spring-keeper smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, methinks thou hast a lean and hungry
look.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hungry&rsquo;s not the word. Starving Belgium
is nothing to me. I feel as though I had had
nothing to eat since yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Skeeter! Think of all that lunch!&rdquo; exclaimed
Lil, lolling back luxuriously in the steamer
chair with grass cloth cushions tucked in
around her. &ldquo;Why, Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;Spring-keeper,
he has done nothing but eat all day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We think it is very hard on you for all of us
to come piling in on you this way,&rdquo; said Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hard on us! Why, Tom Tit and I are so
happy we hardly know what to do to show it,&rdquo;
said the old man kindly. &ldquo;But you must excuse
me while I go prepare some food for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you must let us help!&rdquo; from the girls, although
Lil was rather perfunctory in her offers
of assistance. She felt as though nothing short
of dynamite could get her out of that chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed! Tom Tit and I are famous cooks
and we can get something ready in short order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, sir,&rdquo; said Frank, who had been very
quiet while the others were telling their host of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
their adventures, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;must not stop one moment
to eat or anything else. I want you to tell
me how to find my way back to Greendale so I
can tell the people at the camp that Lucy and Lil
are all right. They were put in our charge, and
I must let them know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I am going, too,&rdquo; put in Skeeter,
&ldquo;but I thought I might eat first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everyone had to laugh at poor Skeeter&rsquo;s rueful
countenance. The spring-keeper smiled
broadly, but he patted Frank on the back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you a telephone at camp?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we had to put one in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, we&rsquo;ll just &rsquo;phone them even before
we begin to cook our feast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Phone! Have you a telephone here?&rdquo; exclaimed
Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear young lady. I love the wildwood,
but I have to know what&rsquo;s going on in the
world. A man who does not take the good the
gods provide him in the way of modern inventions
is a fool. I may be a fool, but I&rsquo;m not that
kind of a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucy, you had better do the &rsquo;phoning so
they&rsquo;ll know you girls are safe, first thing,&rdquo; suggested
Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it had better be done immediately,&rdquo;
said their host. &ldquo;Central in the mountains goes
to roost very early, and you might not get connection.
I&rsquo;ll call up Greendale and make them
give me the camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Connection was got without much trouble and
Lucy took the receiver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello! Is that Camp Carter? Well, this is
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucy! Is it you?&rdquo; in Helen&rsquo;s distracted tones
from the other end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s me, and all of us are all right, but
we are going to spend the night out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About ten miles from Greendale!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean outdoors?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; with a spring-keeper!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A what? Oh, Lucy, are you crazy? We are
so uneasy about all of you, we are nearly wild!
It&rsquo;s dark as can be and we are trying to keep it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
from mother and father that you have not come
home. Tell me where you are. Speak distinctly
and loudly and stop giggling.&rdquo; Of course the usual
giggles had rendered Lucy unable to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Skeeter, come and tell her!&rdquo; she
gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Miss Helen! I&rsquo;m Skeeter. The girls
are all right. Yes, Frank and I are, too. We
got lost somehow and never did find Jude Hanford&rsquo;s,
but we found a kind gentleman who lives
&rsquo;way over on another mountain and he is going
to feed us right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is the gentleman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Spring-keeper is his name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get home somehow tonight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&rsquo;m! Lil is mighty tired and will have to
rest up some. We&rsquo;ll be home tomorrow. You
mustn&rsquo;t worry about the girls&mdash;they&rsquo;re all right
and the gentleman is bully. We&rsquo;ll tell you all
about it when we see you. Say, Miss Helen, the
lunch was out of sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet it was when once Skeeter got his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
hooks into it,&rdquo; muttered Frank. &ldquo;The supper will
be, too, in no time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, good-bye, Skeeter! We are still trusting
you and Frank to take care of our girls and
bring them back safely. I knew all the time you
were doing your best, although I was uneasy
about all of you. I was afraid you had shot each
other or snakes had bitten you or something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not on your life! We shot some squirrels
and got you some fox grapes, though. Good-bye!
Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Miss Helen is a peach,&rdquo; he added
to Frank, after he hung up the receiver. &ldquo;She is
still trusting us.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<span class="f8">TOM TIT</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dying to know who he is and what he is,&rdquo;
whispered Lil to Lucy, as they tidied themselves
up a bit in the neat little room to which the gray-bearded
host had shown them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;m I! Did you ever see such a cute little
room? It looks like a stateroom on the steamboat.
Do you reckon we will sleep in here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a tiny little room with one great window.
Two bunks were built in the wall opposite
the window, one over the other. A little mirror
hung over a shelf whereon the girls found a white
celluloid comb and brush, spotlessly clean&mdash;indeed,
the whole room was so clean that one
doubted its ever having been occupied. The floor
was scrubbed until Lucy said it reminded her of
a well-kept kitchen table. A rag rug was the
only decoration the room boasted and that was a
beautiful thing of brilliant hue. The walls were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
whitewashed, also the doors, of which there were
two, one opening into the main room and the
other one, the girls fancied, into a cupboard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it grand we got lost?&rdquo; from Lil, as she
made a vain endeavor to see her sunburned nose
in the mirror that was hung so high she was
sure Mr. Spring-keeper had never had a female
visitor before, or if he had, it had been a giantess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry up! Your nose is all right.&mdash;Maybe
we can help him some, and I&rsquo;m just dying to hear
the story of his life. Do you reckon he will tell
us all about himself and poor Tom Tit without
our pumping him? I believe he is a king or
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whether the old gentleman were a king or not,
he could certainly cook a supper to a king&rsquo;s taste.
Skeeter&rsquo;s nostrils were quivering with anticipatory
enjoyment as the lost ones took their seats
around the massive table in the comfortable living
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks like a room I saw at the movies last
spring,&rdquo; Frank had said to Skeeter, as they waited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
for the girls to finish dolling up. &ldquo;That one
had a stone fireplace and furniture that looked
just like this, great big tables and chairs that
must have been made out of solid oak or walnut
or something. The hero had fashioned them
himself with a jack-knife, I believe. The mantelpiece
was high just like this one, but there
were skins spread on the floor instead of these
rag rugs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a bully room, and, gee, what a good smell
of eats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The supper was a simple one, consisting of
corn pone and buttermilk, bacon and scrambled
eggs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am giving you exactly what Tom Tit and I
were to have. I only tripled the quantity,&rdquo; said
their host, as they drew up the chairs to the great
table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we aren&rsquo;t so very much trouble?&rdquo; asked
Lil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trouble! Why, my dear young lady, Tom
Tit and I would not live on this thoroughfare if
we did not love visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Thoroughfare!&rdquo; gasped Lucy. Maybe the
old gentleman was daffy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly! You don&rsquo;t know how many
things happen in the mountains. Someone is always
turning up. Eh, Tom Tit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed! We uns finds something every
day. One time it was a baby fox and one time it
was a man in ugly striped pants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He means our convict. It was a poor fellow
who had escaped from a road gang and took refuge
in the mountains and Tom Tit found him almost
starved to death. We fed him up until he
could go back to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t give him up!&rdquo; asked Frank, his
eyes flashing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; he gave himself up. I got him to tell
me just exactly why he was put in the penitentiary,
and since his crime surely warranted some
punishment, I made him understand that the best
thing for him to do was go back to his road making
and expiate his crime. That was much better
than being hounded for the rest of his time.
What do you think about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-e-s, you are right, but I&rsquo;m glad you didn&rsquo;t
give him up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom Tit and I go see him every now and
then. Tom Tit feels sorry for him because his
trousers are so ugly. He likes to work and
wouldn&rsquo;t mind road-building a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we uns digs, we uns finds so many
things, but we uns couldn&rsquo;t wear such ugly pants.
Sometime we uns is a-goin&rsquo; to make the poor
sick man some pretty pink ones like these,&rdquo; and
he stood up to show his bright pink trousers.
They were strangely fashioned, looking rather
like Turkish trousers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was the man sick?&rdquo; asked Lucy, devoutly
praying that a fit of the giggles would not choke
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, Tom Tit and I think that when persons
are what the world and the law calls bad,
they are really sick. Sometimes they are too sick
to be cured, but not often. It is the fault of the
doctors and the system and not theirs when they
are not cured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you live here all the time?&rdquo; asked Lil. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
was dying of curiosity about the strange pair
who were so ill assorted and still so intimate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom Tit does, but I have to go away for a
time every fall and winter and Tom Tit keeps
house for me while I am gone. He is a famous
housekeeper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you get lonesome all by yourself?&rdquo; asked
Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We uns ain&rsquo;t never alone. There&rsquo;s the baby
fox and the cow and the chickens, and every day
we uns tries to find something and then we uns
has to write it down for the spring-keeper &rsquo;ginst
he comes home. Every day we uns has to go to
the post office for the letter, too, and that takes
time. The days in winter are so short.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you get a letter every day? How
jolly! My mother doesn&rsquo;t write to me but once
a week,&rdquo; said Lil, &ldquo;&mdash;although of course she
&rsquo;phones me in the meantime and sends me candy
and things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We uns never does git letters from maw,&rdquo;
and poor Tom Tit&rsquo;s eyes clouded sadly. &ldquo;Ever
since the men came and found her and hid her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
in that hole she ain&rsquo;t writ a line to poor Tom
Tit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you write to her every time you write to
me, don&rsquo;t you, Tom Tit?&rdquo; and the old gentleman
put a calming and kindly hand on the shoulder
of the trembling youth. It seemed that at every
mention of mothers the thought of his own
mother came back to him and the agony he went
through with at the time of her death seized hold
of him. The young people learned later from
their host, while Tom Tit was washing the supper
dishes, all about the poor boy&rsquo;s history.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom Tit&rsquo;s mother was a very fine woman of
an intelligence and character that was remarkable
even in these mountains where intelligence
and character are the rule rather than the exception.
She had no education, but the things she
could accomplish without education were enough
to make the ones who have been educated blush
to think how little they do with it. She had
evolved a philosophy of her own of such goodness
and serenity that to know her and talk with her
was a privilege. She seemed to me to be like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
these mountains, where she was born and where
she died. She had had trouble enough to break
the spirit of any ordinary mortal, but she said
her spirit was eternal and could not be broken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her husband was a very desperate character.
Convicted of illicit distilling, he was sentenced
to serve a term in the penitentiary, but he
managed to escape and for one whole year he
evaded the sheriff, hiding in the mountains. Of
course his wife had to go through the agony of
this long search. She told me she had never
slept more than an hour at a time while her husband
was in hiding. That was the one thing she
was bitter over&mdash;that long hounding of her husband.
She used to say if the government had
spent the money and energy in educating the
mountaineers that they had in hunting for them,
there would have been no cause for hunting for
them. Moonshining is to them a perfectly reasonable
and lawful industry, and nothing but education
can make them see it differently. His
hiding place was finally ferreted out and he was
surrounded and captured, but not before he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
managed to shoot five men, killing two of them
and being fatally wounded himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was many years ago when Tom Tit was
a little chap of three. Melissa, the mother, was
wrapped up in the child. His intelligence then
was keen and his love of Nature and beautiful
things was so pronounced from the beginning
that if this cloud had not come over his intellect
he would surely have been a great artist of some
kind, whether poet, painter or musician, I can&rsquo;t
say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps all of them, like Leonardo da Vinci!&rdquo;
exclaimed Lil, who always did know things.</p>

<p>The old gentleman smiled at her appreciatively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is an artist but a person who finds
things, just like my poor Tom Tit, and then is
able to tell to the world what he has found?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When he writes to you, does he tell you
things in poetical language?&rdquo; asked Lucy, her
gray eyes very teary as she listened to the story
of the mountain youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, his writing is not ordinary writing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
He can neither read nor write as you think of it.
His letters to me are written in another way.
He tells me what he has found each day with
some kind of rude drawing or with some device
of his own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please show us some of them!&rdquo; begged all
four of the guests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to let you guess what he meant.&rdquo;
He took from his desk in the corner a packet
of large envelopes. &ldquo;I leave with my friend
enough addressed and stamped envelopes to run
him until I return, and all he has to do is put in
his letter and seal it and drop it in the box at
Bear Hollow, our post office. Sometimes he
draws me a picture and sometimes he just sends
me something he has found. What do you think
he intended to convey by this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>On a sheet of paper were drawn many stars
of various kinds and sizes, and down in the corner
was what was certainly meant for an axe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clear night and going coon hunting, I think,&rdquo;
said Skeeter solemnly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Lucy and Lil in a breath. &ldquo;Those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
are meant for snow flakes! It has begun to
snow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right you are! Good girls, go up head! And
how about the axe, since it is not meant to signify
coon hunting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is going to be cold,&rdquo; suggested the practical
Frank, &ldquo;and he must go to work and lay in
wood before the snow gets deep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine! I am glad to see there are others who
can interpret my poor Tom Tit&rsquo;s letters. Now
this is the one I received the next day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was evidently meant for a deep snow. The
roof of a house and a few bare branches were
shown but from the chimney a column of smoke
ascended and in that smoke was plainly drawn
a grin: a mouth with teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Snowed under!&rdquo; cried Skeeter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he got his wood cut and is now sitting
by the fire quite happy, even grinning,&rdquo; declared
Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right again! Now comes a piece of holly
and a pressed violet. That means that he finds
a little belated violet in our flower beds in spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
of the fact that the holly is king at this season.
Sometimes he has so much to tell me that he must
make many pictures. Here he found a sunset
and it was so beautiful that he had to paint it
with his colored crayons. This is where he fed
the birds during the deep snow. He has a trough
where he puts grain and seeds and crumbs for
his winged friends. This is a picture of the
trough and see the flocks of birds he has tried
to draw to show how many are fed in his trough.
This means a stranger has come in on him!&rdquo; It
was a picture of a hat and staff and down one
side of the page were many drops of water, at
least that was what the interested audience
thought they were. At the top was an eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know!&rdquo; exclaimed Lil. &ldquo;If a hat and
staff mean a stranger, those drops of water must
mean rain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The eye looks like a Mormon sign,&rdquo; suggested
Skeeter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bet it means this,&rdquo; said Lil, studying the
page intently. &ldquo;It means the stranger is old,
or he would not have a staff, and it means he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
is unhappy. Those drops are tear drops. See
how sad the eye looks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, a Daniel come to judgment!&rsquo; Young
lady, you are right. That was a tired, sick traveler
that our Tom Tit found and brought in and
looked after for two weeks last winter. He was
trying to cross the mountains and got lost and
Tom Tit picked him up, almost starved and
frozen. In this one, he shows the sick guest is
still with him and in bed. He cannot draw faces
well and hates to make anything too grotesque,
so he usually has a sign or symbol for persons.
The staff and hat in bed mean the guest is there.
These little saddle-bags and hat mean he had
to send for the doctor. Look at the medicine the
poor staff and hat must take from the cruel saddle-bags!
His own symbol is usually a jew&rsquo;s-harp,
although sometimes he makes himself a
kind of butterfly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just like Whistler!&rdquo; cried Lil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and in his way he is as great an artist
as Whistler,&rdquo; said the old man sadly. &ldquo;If he
had only had his chance! Well, well! Maybe he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
is happier as he is. I never saw a happier person,
as a rule, than my poor boy. Tom Tit could
never have written letters that would have been
put in a book and called &lsquo;The Gentle Art of
Making Enemies,&rsquo; as that other great artist did.
He makes friends with every living thing, and
inanimate objects are friendly to him, too, I sometimes
think. If his wits had been spared him, the
world would have called him and the peace of
the mountains would no longer have been his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man fingered the packet of letters
tenderly while the young guests sat thoughtfully
by. They could hear the cheerful Tom Tit in
the kitchen washing dishes and whistling a
strange crooning melody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here it is spring and he has found the first
hepatica. See, he sends me a pressed one! And
this is my love letter. What do you make of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was six little stamped envelopes, all with
wings, and in the corner was a jew&rsquo;s-harp unmistakably
dancing a jig.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know! I know!&rdquo; cried Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I!&rdquo; from Lil.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see any kind of sense in it!&rdquo; pondered
Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; grumbled Skeeter. &ldquo;You girls just
make up answers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to whisper my answer to Mr.
Spring-keeper,&rdquo; suggested Lil.</p>

<p>The old man smiled as Lil whispered her answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! Splendid! And now what do you
think?&rdquo; turning to Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that he has only six envelopes left, and
that means you will be back in six days. He is
so happy he is dancing and he is so busy the
days are just flying away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you girls aren&rsquo;t clever! No wonder
they say women are the most appreciative sex although
men are the creative. A few men create
while all women appreciate. And now, my dear
young people, this is so pleasant for me that I
am afraid of being selfish, so I am going to insist
on your going to bed. You have had a hard
day and must be tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have had a wonderful day with a wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
en&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Lil, a yawn hitting her midway
so she could not get out the &ldquo;ding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I hate to go to bed until you tell us something
about yourself,&rdquo; blurted out Skeeter.</p>

<p>The story of the half-witted young mountaineer
was very interesting, no doubt, but Skeeter
wanted to know why this highly educated gentleman
was spending so much time in the mountains,
cooking for himself and taking care of lost
sheep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my story is such an ordinary one I can
tell it while I light a candle for these young ladies,&rdquo;
laughed their host, not at all angry at
Skeeter&rsquo;s curiosity, although Lil and Lucy were
half dead of embarrassment when Skeeter came
out so flat-footed with the question which was
almost bubbling over on their lips, but which
they felt they must not put.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a successful manufacturer&mdash;&mdash; I have
made enough money selling clothes pins and
ironing boards and butter tubs to stop. In fact,
I stopped many years ago and now I do nothing
but enjoy myself in my own way.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And that way is&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trying to help a little. In the winter I live
in New York and teach the boys&rsquo; clubs on the
East Side, and in the summer I am spring-keeper
in the mountains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t your name Mr. Spring-keeper?&rdquo;
asked Lil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my dear, spring-keeping is my occupation.
My name is Walter McRae. Here is your
candle, and pleasant dreams.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell us some more about yourself?&rdquo;
asked Lucy as she took the candle from
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another time! Anything so dry as my story
will keep.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<span class="f8">THE SPRING-KEEPER</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this grand?&rdquo; were the last words both
of our girls uttered as they rolled into the bunks
that had been made up with fresh, lavender-scented
linen. The brigands had captured them
certainly and their adventure was complete. The
boys were sleeping on the porch in hammocks.
Mr. McRae always slept on the porch unless
weather drove him in, and Tom Tit had a little
room that he loved, where he kept his treasures,
all those he did not put in the hole in the mountain.</p>

<p>Dawn found the babes in the wood much refreshed.
The boys were up and out early, helping
Tom Tit milk the cow and chop wood. Mr.
McRae had started the cooking of breakfast when
Lucy and Lil appeared.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We are so ashamed to be late but we almost
slept our heads off,&rdquo; they apologized. &ldquo;Now let
us help!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, set the table and skim the milk and
get the butter out of the dairy.&rdquo; The dairy was
a cave dug in the side of the mountain where all
their food was kept cool in summer and warm in
winter. &ldquo;We shall breakfast on the porch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls made all haste and set the table with
great care.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get him to tell us all about himself this
morning,&rdquo; whispered Lucy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dying to hear
about him. Isn&rsquo;t he romantic?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m crazy about him. Don&rsquo;t you reckon he&rsquo;ll
go to the camp with us? Nan would be wild
over him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but he&rsquo;s ours. We certainly found him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sound like Tom Tit,&rdquo; laughed Lil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope the people at the camp won&rsquo;t laugh at
poor Tom Tit,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;If we could only
get there a little ahead and prepare them for his
pink pants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She need not have worried, as the wise Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
McRae knew how to manage Tom Tit so that he
discarded his pink pants when he was to go
among strangers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Tom Tit, we must hurry with all of our
duties so we can make an early start to walk
home with our guests; and we must put on our
corduroys for such a long tramp, as the brambles
might tear your lovely new trousers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So poor Tom Tit did the outside chores with
the help of the boys, while the girls assisted Mr.
McRae in the house.</p>

<p>Having breakfasted a little after dawn, by
seven o&rsquo;clock they were ready for their ten mile
tramp back to the camp. The boys shouldered
their guns and the sacks of fox grapes and squirrels.
Mr. McRae took with him a small spade
while Tom Tit carried a hoe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help thinking both of them are a bit
loony,&rdquo; Skeeter whispered to Lucy. &ldquo;Why on
earth do they want to carry garden tools on a ten
mile tramp?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Loony yourself! I reckon they want to dig
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>The old gentleman, as though divining Skeeter&rsquo;s
thoughts, remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom Tit and I have a little duty to attend to
today, so we are taking our implements. There
are several springs I have not been able to visit
this summer and I am going to combine duty with
pleasure and look after them today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look after springs! What for?&rdquo; from
Skeeter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I told you that I am a spring-keeper.
Perhaps you don&rsquo;t know what a spring-keeper
is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;o! Not exactly!&rdquo; said Skeeter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, every country child knows that in every
spring there is or should be a spring-keeper to
keep the water clear. It is a kind of crawfish.
It may be a superstition that he really does purify
water. At any rate, it is a pleasing idea that
he can. Whether he can or not, I know I can
help a great deal by digging out of the springs
the old dead roots and vegetable matter that decays
there, so my self-appointed job is to keep
the springs of Albemarle county in condition. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
am sure I have saved many families from typhoid
in the last years. That is something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was born in the mountains, born in a cabin
that stands just where the one I live in now
stands, in fact the chimney is the same one that
has always been there, but the house is new.
When I was a mere lad, about twelve years old,
there was a terrible epidemic of typhoid fever
in the mountains. My whole family was wiped
out by it, my father, mother and two sisters dying
of it. I just did escape with my life and was
nursed back to health by Tom Tit&rsquo;s granny, as
good a woman as ever lived. Afterwards, having
no home ties, I drifted to the city where I
was successful financially. We of the mountains
had not known in the old days what caused
typhoid, but afterwards, when I learned it was
the water we drank, I determined to come back
to my county whenever I could and make some
endeavor to better the conditions. Would God
that I might have been sooner! My poor boy had
an attack of the dread disease just the year before
I got my affairs in condition to leave New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
York, and that is what caused his brain trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom Tit was ahead of the party, gazing up
into the air as his old friend spoke. He had a
rapt expression on his face that made him for the
moment look like Guido Reni&rsquo;s Christ.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; continued the old man, &ldquo;in typhoid,
the temperature is so high that certain
brain tissue seems to be burned out. I am afraid
that is what has happened to my boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of us have been inoculated against typhoid,&rdquo;
said Lucy. &ldquo;Dr. Wright insisted on it&mdash;every
member of the family. Helen kicked like
a steer but she had to do it, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well named, well named, that young doctor!
I try to get the friends in the mountains to submit
to it, too, but it is a difficult matter. I keep
the virus on hand all the time, a fresh supply.
If I can&rsquo;t persuade them to let me give them the
treatment, I can at least keep their springs clean
for them. Sometimes they even object to that,&rdquo;
he laughed, &ldquo;but they can&rsquo;t help it, as I do it
without their leave. They say I take all the taste
out of the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Their way lay around the mountain instead
of over it, the course they had taken the day before,
and much to the amazement of the young
people, they went to the left instead of to the
right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Greendale is that way!&rdquo; declared Frank,
pointing to the east.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Greendale is really due north of us, but I
thought you wanted to go by Jude Hanford&rsquo;s
cabin to do your errand. We could go either
way to the camp from here, but if we go east, we
will miss Jude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if that doesn&rsquo;t beat all!&rdquo; exclaimed
Frank.</p>

<p>Mr. McRae laughed. &ldquo;What would you have
done last night if Tom Tit had not found you and
brought you home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going to lie right down and let the
robins cover me up,&rdquo; said Lil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going to climb the highest tree and
look out and see if I could spy a light, like the
cock in the &lsquo;Musicians of Bremen,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going to follow the path from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
spring,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;I felt sure from the cleanliness
of the spring that we were near some
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I was going to build a fire and skin the
squirrels and have supper,&rdquo; declared Skeeter. &ldquo;I
was just about famished and I knew that food
was what Lil and Lucy needed to put heart in
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; laughed Lil. &ldquo;Much good
burnt squirrel without any salt would do a bruised
heel. That was all that was the matter with
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That ten miles back to the camp seemed much
shorter than it had the day before, and in fact
it was, as they made no digressions on the homeward
trip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must really have walked twenty miles yesterday.
Just think how many times we doubled
on our tracks,&rdquo; said Frank when they finally came
to a familiar spot.</p>

<p>They found Jude Hanford&rsquo;s yard running over
with frying-sized chickens and on his door step
a water bucket full of eggs all ready to take to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the store. Of course he was pleased to sell them
without having to take off the commission for the
middleman. He joined their procession, with
his eggs and three dozen chickens distributed
among the bearers.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<span class="f8">MORE FINDS</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucy as they neared the
camp. &ldquo;Mr. Smith is flying this morning. I
wonder who is with him. He hasn&rsquo;t taken me
yet but he promised to today. Please don&rsquo;t tell
mother. She would be terribly alarmed at the
prospect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s my bird!&rdquo; and Tom Tit dropped
his hoe and the basket of chickens he was carrying
and clasped his hands in an ecstasy of delight.
&ldquo;See, see, how it floats! I have found it
again! I have found it again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom Tit, would you like to fly with that great
bird?&rdquo; asked Lucy gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fly? Oh, I always dream I can fly! Can I
really fly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Tom Tit, if you want to I will give you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
my place. The birdman promised to take me today
and I will get him to take you instead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom Tit looked wonderingly and trustingly at
Lucy. Mr. McRae smiled his approval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be an experience my boy will remember
all his life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spending the night at your home will be one
we will remember always, too. It beat flying,&rdquo;
and all of the wanderers agreed with her.</p>

<p>Mr. Tom Smith was perfectly willing to take
Tom Tit on a flight if he promised to sit still,
which of course he did. The aeroplane was a
great astonishment to him and the fact that the
birdman could leave the bird and talk and walk
filled him with awe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We uns ain&rsquo;t never seen buzzards and eagles
git out&rsquo;n their wings, but then we uns ain&rsquo;t never
been so clost to the big ones, the ones that sails
way up in the clouds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they landed after a rather longer flight
than Tom Smith usually took the would-be flyers,
Tom Tit&rsquo;s expression was that of one who has
glimpsed the infinite. He said not a word for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
moment after he found himself once more on
terra firma, and then he turned to his old friend
and whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Spring-keeper, I have found so many
things that I&rsquo;ll never be sad again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Carters, of course, gave Mr. McRae a
warm welcome. They could not do enough to express
their gratitude for his kindness and hospitality
to their young people. Mrs. Carter was
graciousness itself to the old man, but looked
rather askance at the queer figure of his companion.
I wonder what she would have thought
had she seen his pink calico trousers and his
patched shirt that he considered so beautiful.
Bobby, however, was drawn to him immediately
and treated him just as though he had been another
little boy who had come to see him. He
took his new friend to see all of his bird houses
and water wheels, and Tom Tit followed him
about with adoration in his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We uns kin talk like you uns when we uns
remembers,&rdquo; said Bobby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We uns would like to talk like Spring-keeper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
but always forgits,&rdquo; sighed Tom Tit. &ldquo;Spring-keeper
used to talk just like we uns when he
was little but he&rsquo;s got larnin&rsquo; now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We uns don&rsquo;t never want no larnin&rsquo;,&rdquo; declared
Bobby. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no use. Josh wants to git
larnin&rsquo;, too, but when he does he ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to be
my bes&rsquo; frien&rsquo; no mo&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to be you bes&rsquo;
frien&rsquo; then; I mean, we uns is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a bes&rsquo; frien&rsquo;? We uns ain&rsquo;t never
found one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, a bes&rsquo; frien&rsquo; is somebody you likes to be
with all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, then Spring-keeper is a bes&rsquo; frien&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he is an old man. A bes&rsquo; frien&rsquo; must be
young.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we uns&rsquo;ll have to take the baby fox.
Will that do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, that&rsquo;ll do if&rsquo;n they ain&rsquo;t no boys
around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We uns will keep the baby fox for one of
them things until Josh gits larnin&rsquo; and then you
kin be it,&rdquo; and Tom Tit laughed for joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is you uns ever flew?&rdquo; Tom Tit asked Bobby.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;my mother is so skittish like, she ain&rsquo;t
never let me. She&rsquo;s &rsquo;bout one of the scaredest ladies
they is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We uns&rsquo; maw is done flew away herself and
she didn&rsquo;t mind when we uns went a bit. We
uns useter think that when the men found maw
they took her and hid her in a hole in the ground.
Spring-keeper done tole me lots of times that she
wasn&rsquo;t in the ground but had flew up to heaven,
but we uns ain&rsquo;t never seed no one fly, so we uns
just thought he was a foolin&rsquo;. And you see,&rdquo; he
whispered, &ldquo;Spring-keeper is kinder daffy sometimes,
so the folks say, and we uns has to humor
him. But now&mdash;but now&mdash;we uns done flewed
away up in the air. If we uns kin fly, why maw
kin do it, too. She ain&rsquo;t in a hole in the ground
no mo&rsquo;. We uns almost saw her flyin&rsquo; way up
over the mountain tops.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I mean we uns is a-goin&rsquo; to come to
see you. My father is goin&rsquo; to take me there
some day. Kin you play on the Victrola?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;we uns ain&rsquo;t never seed one. What is
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it makes music.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we uns kin play the jew&rsquo;s-harp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee! I wish I could&mdash;I mean we uns wishes
we uns could. If you show me how to play the
jew&rsquo;s-harp, I&rsquo;ll show you how to play the Victrola.
Come on, I&rsquo;ll show you first while th&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t
nobody in the pavilion. You see, my sisters is
some bossy an&rsquo; they&rsquo;s always sayin&rsquo; I scratch the
records an&rsquo; won&rsquo;t never let me play it by myself,
but they is about the bossiest ever. I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo;
to hurt the old records.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom Tit looked at the Victrola with wondering
eyes while Bobby wound it up. He had seen
a small organ once and the postmistress at Bear
Hollow had a piano, but this musical instrument
was strange indeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-gonter leave the record on that Helen&rsquo;s
been a-playin&rsquo;. I don&rsquo;t know what it is. I can&rsquo;t
read good yet but I reckon it&rsquo;s something pretty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Zimbalist playing the &ldquo;Humoresque.&rdquo;
Fancy the effect of such a wonderful combination
of sounds breaking for the first time on the sensitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
ears of this mountain youth. He had heard
music in the wind and music in the water; the
birds had sung to him and the beasts had talked
to him; but what was this? He stood like one
enchanted, his hands clasped and his lips parted.
At one point in the music when the great artist
was evidently putting his whole soul in it,
Tom Tit began to sob. Tears rolled down his
cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter? Don&rsquo;t you like it?
I&rsquo;ll put a ragtime piece on,&rdquo; cried Bobby, abruptly
stopping the machine with a scraping sound
that certainly proved he was a great scratcher
of records.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, now it&rsquo;s lost! It&rsquo;s lost! We uns thought
we uns had found something beautiful. Where
has it gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you like it then? What made you bawl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We uns has to cry when we uns finds something
beautiful sometimes. We uns cries a little
when the sun sets but it is tears of happiness.
Can you uns play that again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; and Bobby started up the &ldquo;Humoresque&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
again and this time Tom Tit dried his
eyes and stood with a smile on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Spring-keeper!&rdquo; he cried when Mr. McRae
came hunting him, &ldquo;we uns has found something
more beautiful than sunsets and flowers&mdash;prettier
than birds&mdash;prettier than pink&mdash;prettier
than blue or yellow. It shines like dew and tastes
like honey&mdash;Oh, Spring-keeper, listen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my boy, it is beautiful. And now I think
you have found enough things for today and we
must go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go home and leave this!&rdquo; and Tom Tit embraced
the Victrola. &ldquo;We uns can&rsquo;t leave it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, my boy! I will get one for you. I
don&rsquo;t know why I never thought of it before.
Within a week you shall have one all your own
and play it as much as you choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course Bobby had to be instructed in the
rudiments of jew&rsquo;s-harp playing first, according
to agreement, and then with many expressions
of mutual regard our young people parted from
the spring-keeper and Tom Tit.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<span class="f8">A DISCUSSION</span></h2>


<p>August was over and our girls were not sorry.
The camp had been like an ant hill all during
that month of holidays. Not that it had been a
month of holidays for the Carters, far from it.
There had been times when they did not see how
they could accomplish the work they had undertaken.
They were two hands short almost all
of the month which made the work fall very heavily
on the ones who were left. Gwen was taken
up with Aunt Mandy, the kind old mountain
woman who had been so good to the little English
orphan. Now that Aunt Mandy was ill,
Gwen felt it her duty to be with her day and
night. Susan was so busy waiting on Mrs. Carter
that she never had time for her regular duties
in the kitchen.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>Lewis and Bill were terribly missed. They
had done so many things for the campers, had
been so strong and willing and untiring in their
service that the girls felt the place could hardly
be run without them. Skeeter and Frank did
all they could but they were but slips of lads after
all and there were many things where a man&rsquo;s
strength was necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter was glad to help when he was called
on, but he did not seem to see the things that were
to be done without having them pointed out.
When there was much of a crowd he rather
shrank from the noise and the girls felt they must
not let him be made nervous by the confusion.
Of course there was much confusion when twenty
and more boarders would arrive at once, have to
be hauled up the mountain and assigned tent
room and then as Oscar would say, &ldquo;have to be
filled up.&rdquo; The girls would do much giggling
and screaming; the young men would laugh a
great deal louder than their jokes warranted, and
the boys seemed to think that camp was a place
especially designed for practical jokes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a common thing to hear shrieks from the
tents when the crowd was finally made to retire
by the chaperone, and then the cry, &ldquo;Ouch!
Chestnut burrs in my bed!&rdquo; Once it was a lemon
meringue pie, brought all the way from Richmond
by an inveterate joker who felt that a certain
youth was too full of himself and needed
taking down a peg! Now there is nothing much
better than a lemon meringue pie taken internally,
but of all the squashy abominations to find in
one&rsquo;s bed and to have applied externally, a lemon
meringue pie is the worst.</p>

<p>It was as a censor of practical jokes that Douglas
and Helen missed the young soldiers most.
They had been wont to stand just so much and
no more from the wild Indians who came to
Camp Carter for the week-end, and now that
there was no one to reach forth a restraining
hand, there was no limit to the pranks that were
played.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter felt that the job of chaperone for
such a crowd was certainly no sinecure. She
complained quite bitterly of her duties. After all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
they consisted of having the new-comers introduced
to her and of presiding at supper and of
staying in the pavilion until bed time. Miss
Elizabeth Somerville had made nothing of it,
and one memorable night when there was too
much racket going on from the tents the boys
occupied, she had arisen from her bed in the
cabin and, wrapped in a dressing gown and
armed with an umbrella, had marched to the seat
of war and very effectively quelled the riot by
laying about her with said umbrella.</p>

<p>The girls looked back on her reign, regretting
that it was over. It was lovely to have their
mother with them again but she was quite different
from the mother they had known in Richmond
in the luxurious days. That mother had
always been gentle while this one had a little
sharp note to her voice that was strange to them.
It was most noticeable when she had expressed
some desire that was not immediately gratified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am quite tired of chicken,&rdquo; she said to Douglas
one day. &ldquo;I wish you would order some
sweetbreads for me. I need building up. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
rough life is very hard on me and nothing but
my being very unselfish and devoted makes me
put up with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother! I am sorry, but my order for
this week is in the mail and I could not change
it now, but I will send a special order for some
Texas sweetbreads to Charlottesville. I have no
doubt I can get them there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Either the order or the sweetbreads went
astray. Mrs. Carter refused to eat any dinner in
consequence and sulked a whole day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she only doesn&rsquo;t complain to father we can
stand it,&rdquo; Douglas confided to Nan. &ldquo;What are
we going to do, Nan? I am so afraid she will
make father feel he must go back to work, and
then all the good of the rest will be done away
with. She treats me, somehow, as though it were
all my fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, honey, you mustn&rsquo;t feel that way.
Poor little mumsy is just spoiled to death and
does not know how to adapt herself to this change
of fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, Nan, now that Mr. Lane has had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
to go to Texas with the militia the business is at
a standstill. He was trying to fill the orders
they had on their books without father&rsquo;s help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Tucker said that father&rsquo;s business
was a one man affair and when that one man,
father, was out of the running there was nothing
to do about it. Thank goodness, father is not
worrying about things himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know we should be thankful, but somehow
his not worrying makes it just so much more
dreadful. I feel that he is even more different
than mother. It is an awful problem&mdash;what to
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a problem?&rdquo; asked Helen, coming
suddenly into the tent where her sisters were engaged
in the above conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, just&mdash;just&mdash;nothing much!&rdquo; faltered
Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s a nice way to treat a partner.
You and Nan are always getting off and whispering
together and not letting me in on it.
What&rsquo;s worrying you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The situation!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Political or climatic?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carteratic!&rdquo; drawled Nan. &ldquo;We were talking
about mother and father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about them? Is father worse?&rdquo; Helen
was ever on the alert when her father&rsquo;s well-being
was in question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he is better in some ways, but unless he
is kept free from worry he will never be well,&rdquo;
said Douglas solemnly.</p>

<p>She had not broached the subject of money
with Helen since the question of White Sulphur
had been discussed by them, feeling that Helen
would not or could not understand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to worry him? Not I!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not you. Just the lack of money is
going to worry him, and he is going to feel the
lack of it if mother wants things and can&rsquo;t have
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you let her have them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I? I haven&rsquo;t the wherewithal any
more than you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought we were making money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we are, but not any great amount. I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
it is wonderful that we have been able to support
ourselves and put anything in the bank. I
had to draw out almost all of our earnings to pay
for the things mother bought in New York, not
that I wasn&rsquo;t glad to do it, but that means we
have not so much to go on for the winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, for goodness&rsquo; sake don&rsquo;t be worrying
about the winter now! Mother says our credit
is so good we need not worry a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas and Nan looked at each other sadly.
Douglas turned away with a &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the use&rdquo; expression.
Helen looked a little defiant as she
saw her sister&rsquo;s distress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here, Helen!&rdquo; and this time Nan did not
drawl. Helen realized her little sister was going
to say something she must listen to. &ldquo;You
have got a whole lot of sense but you have got a
whole lot to learn. I know you are going to laugh
at me for saying you have got to learn a lot that
I, who am two years younger than you, already
know. You have got to learn that our poor little
mumsy&rsquo;s judgment is not worth that,&rdquo; and Nan
snapped her finger.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan! You ought to be ashamed of yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am ashamed of myself, but I am telling
the truth. I don&rsquo;t see the use in pretending
any more about it. I love her just as much, but
anyone with half an eye can see it. I think what
we must do is to face it and then tactfully manage
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas and Helen could not help laughing
at Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;it is up to us to
support the family somehow and make mumsy
comfortable and keep her from telling father
that she hasn&rsquo;t got all she wants. Of course she
can&rsquo;t have all she wants, but she can be warm and
fed at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Nan, it isn&rsquo;t up to you to support the
family,&rdquo; said Douglas. &ldquo;You must go back to
school, you and Lucy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it is up to me to spend just as little
money as possible and to earn some if I can.
I am not going to be a burden on you and Helen.
You needn&rsquo;t think it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have the one hundred from the rent of
the house and then Helen and I shall have to
find jobs. What, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I, for one, can&rsquo;t find a job until I get
some new clothes,&rdquo; declared Helen. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
a thing that is not hopelessly out of style.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t your last winter&rsquo;s suit be done over?
Mine can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Douglas, what&rsquo;s the use in going
around looking like a frump? I think we should
all of us get some new clothes and then waltz in
and get good jobs on the strength of them. If
I were employing girls I should certainly choose
the ones who look the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas shook her head sadly. Helen was
Helen and there was no making her over. She
would have to learn her lesson herself and there
was no teaching her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Wright says we must keep father out
of the city this winter but we need not be in the
dead country. We can get a little house on the
edge of town so Nan and Lucy can go in to
school. I think we can get along on the rent from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the house if you and I can make something besides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the question of where they were to live
for the winter was broached to Mrs. Carter, she
was taken quite ill and had to stay in bed a whole
day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one considers me at all,&rdquo; she whimpered
to Nan, who had brought her a tray with some
tea and toast for her luncheon. &ldquo;Just because
you and Douglas like the country you think it is
all right. I am sure I shall die in some nasty
little frame cottage in the suburbs. It is ridiculous
that we cannot turn those wretched people
out of my house and let me go back and live in
it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, mumsy,&rdquo; soothed Nan, &ldquo;we are going to
make you very comfortable and we will find a
pretty house and maybe it will be brick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But to dump me down in the suburbs when
I have had to be away from society for all these
months as it is! I am sure if I could talk it over
with your father he would agree with me&mdash;but
you girls even coerce me in what I shall and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
shall not say to my own husband. I do not intend
to submit to it any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother, please&mdash;please don&rsquo;t tell father.
Dr. Wright says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me what Dr. Wright says! I am
bored to death with what he says. I know he
has been kind but I can&rsquo;t see that our affairs
must be indefinitely directed by him. I will sleep
a little now if you will let me be quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

<span class="f8">DR. WRIGHT TO THE RESCUE</span></h2>


<p>Nan went sadly off. What should she do? Dr.
Wright was expected at the camp that afternoon
and she determined to speak to him and
ask him once more to interfere in the Carters&rsquo;
affairs. Even if the young physician did bore
her mother, it was necessary now for him to
step in. If only she would not carry out her
threat of speaking to her husband!</p>

<p>Dr. Wright treated the matter quite seriously
when Nan told him of the mix-up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly your father must not be worried.
It is quite necessary that he shall be kept out
of the city for many months yet and no one must
talk money to him. Can&rsquo;t your mother see this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t seem to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Helen understands, surely!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;think Helen thinks father is so much
better that we can&mdash;we can&mdash;kind of begin to
spend again,&rdquo; faltered Nan, whose heart misgave
her, fearing she might be saying something to
obstruct the course of true love which her romantic
little soul told her was going on between
Helen and Dr. Wright. At least she could not
help seeing that he was casting sheep&rsquo;s eyes at
Helen, and that while Helen was not casting them
back at him she was certainly not averse to his
attentions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Begin to spend again! Ye gods and little
fishes! Why, if bills begin to be showered in
again on Robert Carter I will not answer for his
reason. He is immensely improved, but it is only
because he has had no worries. Where is your
mother?&rdquo; His face looked quite stern and his
kind blue eyes were not kind at all but flashed
scornfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is in bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly&mdash;she&mdash;she&mdash;is kind of depressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Depressed! Depressed over what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dr. Wright, I hate to be telling you these
things! It looks as though I did not love my
mother to be talking about her, but indeed I do.
Douglas and I are so miserable about it, but
we&mdash;we&mdash;somehow we feel that we are a great
deal older than mumsy. We know it is hard on
her&mdash;all of this&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This living such a rough life&mdash;and having to
give up society and our pretty house and everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it is hard, but then aren&rsquo;t all of
you giving up things, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t mind&mdash;at least we don&rsquo;t mind
much. It is harder on Helen and mother because&mdash;because
they&mdash;they are kind of different.
And they don&rsquo;t understand money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you understand it?&rdquo; laughed the
young doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Douglas and I understand it better.
We know that when you spend a dollar you
haven&rsquo;t got a dollar, but Helen and mother seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
to think if you haven&rsquo;t got it you can charge it.
I think they are suffering with a kind of disease&mdash;chargitis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George Wright was looking quite solemn as he
made his way to the cabin where Mrs. Carter
had taken to her bed. He was not relishing the
idea of having to speak to the wife of his patient,
but speak he must. He knew very well
that Nan would never have come to him if matters
had not reached a crisis. How would Helen
take his interference? He could not fool himself
into the belief that what Helen said and
thought made no difference to him. It made all
the difference in the world. But duty was duty
and since he was ministering to a mind diseased,
he must guard that mind from all things that were
harmful to it, just as much as a doctor who is
treating an open wound must see that it is kept
aseptic. If Robert Carter&rsquo;s wife was contemplating
upsetting the good that had been done
her husband, why, it was his duty as that husband&rsquo;s
physician to warn her of the result.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter was looking very lovely and pathetic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
acting the invalid. An extremely dainty
and costly negligee accentuated her beauty. Her
cabin room, while certainly not elegant, was perfectly
comfortable and kept in spotless condition
by the devoted Susan. There were no evidences
of rough living in her surroundings and the
hand which she extended feebly to welcome the
physician could not have been smoother or whiter
had it belonged to pampered royalty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Dr. Wright, it is kind of you to come in
to see me.&rdquo; She smiled a wan smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry you are ill. What is troubling
you?&rdquo; He felt her pulse, and finding it quite
regular, he smiled, but did not let her see his
amusement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it is my heart. I can make no exertion
without great effort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any appetite?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, very little&mdash;I never eat much, and I am
so tired of chicken! Fried chicken, broiled
chicken, stewed chicken!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, spring chicken is a great hardship, no
doubt,&rdquo; he said rather grimly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I like broiled chicken very much in the spring,
but I never did care very much for chicken in the
summer. People seem to have chicken so much
in the summer. I never could see why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might be because it is cheaper when they
are plentiful,&rdquo; he suggested, finding it difficult
to keep the scorn he felt for this foolish little
butterfly out of his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is, I never thought of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen came in just then, bringing a bouquet
of garden flowers that Mr. McRae had sent to
the ladies of the camp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might as well tackle them together,&rdquo; he
thought, taking a long breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahem&mdash;are your plans for the winter made
yet?&rdquo; he asked Mrs. Carter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the girls&mdash;at least Douglas and Nan,
have some ridiculous scheme about taking a cottage
in the suburbs and letting those people keep
my house. I don&rsquo;t see why I need call it my
house, however, as I seem to have no say-so in
the matter,&rdquo; she answered complainingly. &ldquo;Helen
and I both think it would be much more sensible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
to go into our own house and be comfortable.
Douglas is very unreasonable and headstrong.
The paltry sum that these tenants pay is the only
argument she has against our occupying the
house ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Mrs. Carter, but as your husband&rsquo;s
physician, I may perhaps be able to point
out the relation of the steady, if small, income
from the house and his very serious condition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I thought he was almost well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, madam, much better but not almost well!
Do you think that if he were almost well he
would sit passively down and let his daughters
decide for him as he is doing now? Has he not
always been a man of action, one to take the initiative?
Look at him now, not even asking what
the plans are when you leave the camp, which
you will have to do in the course of a few weeks.
Can&rsquo;t you see that he is still in a very nervous
state and the least little worry might upset his
reason? No troubles must be taken to him. He
must not be consulted about arrangements any
more than Bobby would be. His tired brain is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
beginning to recover and a few more months
may make him almost himself again, but,&rdquo; and
Dr. Wright looked so stern and uncompromising
that Helen and her mother felt that the accusing
angel had them on the last day, the day of
judgment, &ldquo;if he is worried by all kinds of foolish
little things, there will be nothing for him but
a sanitarium. I am hoping that he will be spared
this, and it rests entirely with his family whether
he is spared it or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Doctor, I shall try!&rdquo; and poor little Mrs.
Carter looked very like Bobby and not much
older. &ldquo;I have been very remiss. I did not know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another thing,&rdquo; and the accusing angel went
on in a stern voice. He had heard all of this before
from this little butterfly woman and he felt
that he must impress upon her even more the importance
of guarding her husband from all financial
worries. &ldquo;If when he&rsquo;s well he finds bills to
be paid and obligations to be met, he will drop
right back into the condition in which I found
him last May when I was called to the case. You
remember,&rdquo; and he turned to Helen, &ldquo;his troubled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
talk about lamb chops and silk stockings, do you
not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen dropped the gay bouquet and covered
her face with her hands. Great sobs shook her
frame. Remember! Could she ever forget it?
And yet she had been behaving as though she
had forgotten it, only that morning insisting she
must have a new suit before she could get a job.
What was Dr. Wright thinking of her? He had
spoken so sternly and looked so scornful.</p>

<p>His scorn was all turned to concern now. He
had not meant to distress Helen so much, only
to impress upon her the importance of not letting
financial worries reach her father. He looked
at the poor stricken little woman who seemed to
have shrivelled up into a wizened little child who
had just been punished. Had he been too severe
in his harangue? Well, nothing short of
severity would reach the selfish heart of Mrs.
Carter. But Helen&mdash;Helen was not selfish, only
thoughtless and young. He had not meant to
grieve her like this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; was all he could say.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems awful that we should be so blind that
you should have to say such things to us,&rdquo; said
Helen, trying to control her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I am a worthless woman,&rdquo; said the
poor little mother plaintively. &ldquo;Nobody ever expected
me to be anything else and I have never
been anything else. I don&rsquo;t understand finance&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t understand life. Please call Douglas
and Nan here, Helen. I want to speak to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me do it,&rdquo; said the young doctor eagerly.
He felt that running away from the scene of disaster
would be about the most graceful thing he
could do just then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe I should like you to be here if you
don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan and Douglas were quickly summoned, indeed
they were near the cabin, eagerly waiting
to hear the outcome of the interview that they
well knew Dr. Wright was having with their
mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My daughters,&rdquo; began the little lady solemnly,
&ldquo;I have just come to the realization of my
worthlessness. I want all of you to know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
I do realize it, and with Dr. Wright as witness
I want to resign in a way as&mdash;as&mdash;as a guardian
to you. Your judgment is better than mine and
after this I am going to trust to it rather than
to my own. I know nothing about money, nothing
about economy. Douglas, you will have to be
head of the family until your poor father can take
up his burdens again. Whatever you think best
to do, I will do. Treat me about as you treat
Bobby and Lucy&mdash;no, not Lucy&mdash;even Lucy&rsquo;s
judgment is better than mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas was on her knees by the bedside, holding
her mother in her arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mumsy! Mumsy! Don&rsquo;t talk that way
about yourself. It &rsquo;most kills me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan buried her face in her hands. She was
sure she felt worse than any of them because
she had given voice to exactly the same truth
concerning her mother in her conversation with
Douglas and Helen.</p>

<p>Dr. Wright would have been glad if he had
never been born, but since he had been he would
have welcomed with joy an earthquake if it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
only come at that moment and swallowed him
up. Would Helen ever forgive him? He had no
idea he was having such an effect on Mrs. Carter.
She had seemed to him heartless and selfish
and stubborn. She was in reality nothing but a
child. She was no more responsible than Bobby
himself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter, childlike, was in a way enjoying
herself very much. Had she not been punished
and now were not all the grownups sorry for her
and petting her? She had announced her policy
for ever after and now nothing more was ever
to be expected of her. Life was not to be so hard
after all. Her Robert was still in a way ill, but
he would get well finally, and now Douglas would
take hold and think for her. Her girls would
look after her and take care of her. She regretted
not having a debutante daughter, as she well
knew that society was one thing she could do,
but since that was to be denied her, she would
be the last person in the world to make herself
disagreeable over her disappointment. A saccharine
policy was to be hers on and after this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
date. Unselfishness and sweetness were to be
synonymous with her name.</p>

<p>All of the daughters kissed her tenderly and
Dr. Wright bent over her fair hand with knightly
contrition.</p>

<p>How pleasant life was!</p>

<p>A tray, more daintily arranged than usual,
was brought in at supper time, and under a covered
dish there reposed the coveted sweetbreads.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<span class="f8">LETTERS</span></h2>


<p class="center">Miss Nan Carter from Mr. Thomas Smith</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="smcap right"><span class="in2">By Wireless from the Clouds,</span><br />
<br />
<span class="right">September .., 19..</span><br /></p>

<p class="smcap">My dear Wood Nymph:</p>

<p>I have made many flights and many landings
but no landing has been so delightful as the one
I made on Helicon and no flight so beautiful as
when a certain little wood nymph deigned to accompany
me.</p>

<p>I think very often of the few happy days I
spent at Week-End Camp and of the hospitable
Carters. The picnic on the fallen tree was the
very best picnic I ever attended and the game of
teakettle the best game I ever played.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>Some day, and not so many years hence I
hope it will be, I intend to make a flight and take
my teakettle with me. Guess what that word is!</p>

<p class="center">Miss Douglas Carter from Mr. Lewis Somerville</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right smcap">Brownsville, Texas, September .., 19..<br /></p>

<p class="smcap">My dear Douglas:</p>

<p>Your letter telling of the doings of the camp
made Bill and me mighty blue. We think maybe
we should not have left you when we did, but we
felt we were getting too soft hanging round you
girls all the time, and then, too, we wanted to let
Uncle Sam know that we were willing to do any
kind of old work that came up to do. If he
wanted to ship us from West Point, all well and
good&mdash;that was his own affair, but we feel that
since he has given us three years&rsquo; education we
must pay him back somehow, and enlisting is
about the only way we can do it. At first we
thought perhaps it had better be with the volunteers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
and then we thought maybe the regulars
could do better service, so regulars it is. It does
seem funny to be in the ranks when we had always
expected to be officers, but that is all right&mdash;we
are not grouching. No doubt it is good for
us. At least we can get the outlook of the private,
and if because of bravery or luck we ever
rise from the ranks, we can better understand
the men under us.</p>

<p>It is awfully hot down here but just when it is
so hot that you feel you must turn over on the
other side to keep from burning and to brown
evenly, why a wind comes up they call &ldquo;a norther&rdquo;
and you sizzle like a red hot poker stuck into cold
water. A norther is about the coldest and most
penetrating thing I have ever struck. We never
seem to catch cold, however. The norther blows
all the germs off of one, I fancy.</p>

<p>Bill is fine. Already he is known by his guffaw.
He let out a laugh the other day that made General
Funston jump, and I can tell you that is going
some. Not many people can lay claim to the
distinction of having made that great man jump.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
I think they ought to send Bill out to hunt Villa.
If that bandit is hiding in the mountains, I bet
Bill could laugh loud enough to make him peep
out to see what&rsquo;s up. He&rsquo;s mighty soft on Tillie
Wingo and carries her tin-type around his
neck.</p>

<p>I want to tell you, dear Douglas, that I think
you were just exactly right to turn me down the
way you did. I am ashamed of myself to have
asked you to think of me when I realize how far
I am from success. I may be a private for the
rest of my life and what could I offer a girl like
you? I know it wasn&rsquo;t that that kept you from
being engaged to me, but it would have been
very ridiculous for me to have bound you by a
promise when I may be old and gray-headed before
I even get a sergeant&rsquo;s stripes.</p>

<p>Please write to me when you find time and
tell me what the plans are for the winter. I wish
I could help you some, but about all I am good
for is to keep the Mexicans from getting into
Texas and maybe finding their way up to Virginia,
where you are. I feel about as big as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
grain of sand on a Texan prairie. My love to all
the Carters.</p>

<p><span class="sign2">Your very affectionate cousin,</span><br />

<p class="center">Miss Helen Carter from Dr. George Wright</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right smcap">Richmond, Va., September .., 19..<br /></p>

<p class="smcap">My dear Miss Helen:</p>

<p>The thought of having wounded you is very
bitter to me. I did not mean to be unkind either
to you or your mother. I know you must wish
you had never seen me. I seem to have spent
my time since I first met you making myself unpleasant.
If you can forgive me, please write
and say so. I hope your mother is better and
that her appetite has returned. If I can be of
any service to you at any time and in any way,
you must call on me.</p>

<p><span class="sign2">Very sincerely,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">George Wright.</span><br /></p>

<p class="center">Miss Lucy Carter from Frank Maury</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right smcap">Richmond, Va., September .., 19..<br /></p>

<p class="smcap">Dear Lucy:</p>

<p>Not much on writing but here goes. Skeeter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
and I took Lil to the movies last night and we
wished for you some. Movies don&rsquo;t touch the
tramps in the mountains but they are better than
nothing. When are you going to leave those diggings
and come back to the good old burg?
Skeeter ate three cream puffs and two ice cream
cones after the show and washed them down
with a couple of chocolate milk shakes. Mrs.
Halsey says she may have to go to boarding to
fill her hopeful up. I pity the boardinghouse
keeper. The worst thing about Skeeter is that he
never shows his keep. After all those weeks in
the mountains and all those good eats he is as
skinny as ever. Do you ever see Mr. Spring-keeper
and Tom Tit? I sent Tom Tit a rag time
record for his new Victrola. It is a peach and I
bet it will set him to dancing to beat a jew&rsquo;s-harp.
Lil, who is mighty missish, says Tom Tit has too
good taste to like such common music but I just
know he will like it. Skeeter sends his regards.
He and I are both to have military training at
the high school so you will see us in skimpy
blue gray uniforms when you come back to Richmond.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
Skeeter looks powerful skinny in his. I
don&rsquo;t know what I look like in mine.</p>

<p><span class="sign2">Yours truly,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">Frank Maury.</span><br /></p>
</div>

<p>The silence of September settled down upon
Camp Carter. The mountains had never been
more glorious nor a period of rest and recreation
more welcome. Noise, numbers, confusion&mdash;all
were conspicuously absent. To look back was
gratifying and to feel an inward sense of &ldquo;well
done!&rdquo; was satisfying.</p>

<p>The summer was over for the Carter girls but
their work was by no means finished. Unforeseen
obstacles were no doubt to be met and overcome;
many problems were to puzzle them and
hard lessons were to be learned. But at the same
time happy days were to be in store for them,
their lives, like all of ours, a mixture of sunshine
and shadow, work and play. They looked toward
the future with eager hope. In &ldquo;The Carter
Girls&rsquo; Mysterious Neighbors&rdquo; we will hear how
they came in touch with some of the wide-reaching
events of the world war.</p>
